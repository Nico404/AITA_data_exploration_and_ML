# AITA_data_exploration_and_ML

This project is a series of Jupyter notebooks.

In our previous project, we fetched thousands of posts and comments from Reddit.

We're now deep diving into the data to actually build our Text Classifier and hopefully be able to categorize a post from the AITA subreddit.
