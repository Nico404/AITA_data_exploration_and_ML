    "Accuracy is a performance metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It represents the percentage of correctly classified instances out of the total instances in the dataset. In other words, accuracy measures how often the model is correct in its predictions. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of correctly classified instances to the total number of instances in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss: Loss value indicates how well the model is performing during training. It is a numerical representation of the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs. The lower the loss value, the better the model is at making accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision: Precision measures how many of the predicted positive labels are actually correct. It is the proportion of true positives (TP) over the sum of true positives and false positives (FP). In other words, it answers the question: \"Out of all the predicted positive cases, how many are actually positive?\" A high precision score means that the model has a low false positive rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall: Recall measures how many of the actual positive cases were correctly identified by the model. It is the proportion of true positives over the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN). In other words, it answers the question: \"Out of all the actual positive cases, how many did the model correctly identify as positive?\" A high recall score means that the model has a low false negative rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "F1 score: F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It combines both measures and provides a more balanced evaluation of the model's performance. The F1 score is calculated as 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall). It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 represents the best possible performance and 0 represents the worst.\n",
