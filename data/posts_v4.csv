10uxee0,1181,"I know this post sounds super petty, but this is the most ridiculous fight I've had with my boyfriend, and unfortunately it's where we're at.I \[F28\] have never shaved in my life. I think it's up to the person regardless, but I've also just never really had a lot of hair. My boyfriend recently stayed over and asked to borrow a razor. Since I don't shave, I didn't have one on hand, and apparently that grossed him out. He told me that it was unhygienic to not shave and we argued back and forth about the issue when I finally told him that I'd only start shaving my legs if he shaved his first. He called me immature and petty, whereas I think he's being super fixated on this weird thing. It honestly wouldn't really bother me to shave, but I'm just more irked at his statements where he basically called me dirty. I was serious though: I'll shave whenever he shaves too.We're at an impasse but I wonder if I *am* being a little too petty about the whole thing.",AITA for telling my boyfriend I'll shave my legs if he shaves his?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uxee0/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_ill_shave_my_legs/
10ur722,1849,"My daughter Bryn F9 is going on a trip to a nearby water park with her class next week. She loves water and has been talking about it for months, so I was a bit thrown off when she came home crying a few days ago and told me she didn’t want to go. I asked her why and she wouldn't tell me because she thought I’d think she’s a “bad person.” When I finally coaxed it out of her, she said her teacher “Ms. N” has forced her to be the “buddy” of her classmate “Ben” for the entirety of the trip. She was to ride the bus with Ben to and from the trip, eat lunch with him, and go on all the rides with him instead of spending time with her friends. She then said nobody likes Ben because he whines whenever they have to do work and picks his nose and wipes boogers everywhere.I was horrified, not only because Ms. N had made Bryn do such a thing, but also because she had made her believe she was a bad person for not wanting to. Unfortunately this wasn’t my first experience with Ms. N, as she frequently used my soft-spoken, intelligent older daughter as a “behavior buffer” for the naughty boys until I threatened to report her to the superintendent. It’s clear to me that Ms. N is still too comfortable with enforcing archaic gender roles on her kids and forcing girls to do unpaid emotional labor for the sake of the boys. I immediately sent Ms. N an email condemning her actions. She sent me back an email with a bunch of bs that basically ended with “if Bryn goes on the trip, she has to be Ben’s buddy.” *Fine.* I informed her Bryn would not be attending then. I immediately booked VIP tickets the same day her class was going so she could still go to the park and see her friends.What happened next I wasn’t expecting. Bryn is quite popular, so I have gotten to know a lot of the moms in her class. When I let them know what Ms. N did, some of them were so horrified that they also pulled their kids out of the trip. In total, eight kids (out of a class of twenty) are either not going, or going with us. Today I got an email from Ms. N saying that because almost half of the class isn’t going, they either have to raise the cost for the other students or not go at all. She practically begged me to let Bryn go and tell all the other parents to let their kids go, promising she wouldn’t make Bryn do anything she didn’t want to do. I told her she should have thought about that before she tried to make my daughter do *her* job. My husband said I was being a bit petty and that Ms. N clearly feels bad about what she did, and I should let Bryn go as I’ve already gotten my way. He asked me if I really wanted to deprive children of what they’ve been waiting for all year. The thing is, if this wasn’t Ms. N’s first offense I probably would have agreed, but she has a pattern of this type of behavior and hopefully this will put a stop to it. Plus, if she has to explain this to her superiors, I have receipts. Is my husband right? Or am I justified?&amp;#x200B;UPDATE: Bryn WAS the only student assigned a ""buddy.""

10upxdd,1180,"Alright so my son (17) has weekly therapy appointments that I take him to. Unfortunately, my husband let our daughter borrow his car and then had an emergency at work so he had to use my car so my son and I had to take the bus. It wasn’t ideal, but I’d rather the bus than miss an appointment. While it isn’t my place to share why he goes to therapy, I will say that he will often forget to eat. I usually make sure he’s fed, but due to the mess in the morning, it slipped my mind. The bus wasn’t too crowded but all the seats were taken. My son wasn’t doing too well and I could tell he was feeling dizzy from hunger+the bus. So the second someone got off their seat, I sat him down. I then tried to find a chocolate bar I had in my bag. While this is happening, I noticed an elderly woman and her adult daughter standing beside us. I didn’t pay much attention until the daughter tapped me on the shoulder. She asked if my son could move so that her elderly mother could have a seat. I felt really bad, I really did, but my son was not doing great and standing would make it harder. I had found the chocolate and he was eating it slowly but if he stood up right then, I can assure you he would’ve fainted. I apologized to her and explained that my son wasn’t feeling well. She rolled her eyes at me and said that she saw him standing earlier and that he’s a young healthy teenage boy-he’ll be fine. I apologized once again and told her that he wasn’t feeling well and that if he was then HE himself would’ve offered her a seat. The daughter told me to look at her mother and I admit, the poor woman looked really tired. But I couldn’t. My son had started to lean against me so I told the woman one last time that I was sorry and to ask someone else.I then heard them both whispering and calling me an entitled bitch. And when we got off the bus, a woman that got off with us said that a teenage boy can handle standing more than an elderly woman can and that she hopes someone treats me like that when I’m her age.

10v2vra,131,We live three blocks away from my parents and they see our kids almost every day.  Hey husband's parents live a couple of states away and only see the kids a few times a year. It's easy when we go see them since we only visit when the kids are off school.  But when they come see us it is at random intervals through the year.  Not a problem really they are excellent grandparents.  With one small exception. They think our rules go out the window when they visit.  It's mean that we don't make the kids their favorite food every day.  Why can't the kids watch tv with them before they do their chores and homework.  Why do the kids have to be in bed so early.  It drives me crazy that I'm the bad guy because my husband won't put his foot down so I have to do it.  They came last week.  On Monday ss soon as dinner was over they wanted the kids to pay attention to them. They wanted to take the kids to see Avatar.  On a school night.  My husband allowed it.  Last straw.  I told him that he knew that throwing the kids off there schedule screwed me over.  So I gave him the choice of either enforcing our rules or I would.  He said he would take care of it.  Second night there was a hockey game on.  He wanted to watch it with our son who loves hockey.  I reminded my husband that our son had chores to do and homework.  He said it was just a hockey game.  I told the kids to get their stuff.  I took them and a change of clothes and their homework to my parents house.  My mom and dad will watch them and then take them to school in the morning.  I went back home and they were waiting for me.  I'm being a controlling and abusive person by denying them time with the kids. I'm not the only person allowed to make decisions regarding the kids.  They came all this way to see them and I'm being a jerk by keeping them on a schedule.  Fine.  They are visiting for a couple of weeks.  Wednesday after I picked up the kids from school and dropped them off at home with my in-laws. Then I went out for the first time in ages.  I told my husband I would be out late and didn't want to wake anyone so I would be at my parents house.  Did the same thing Thursday through tonight.  My husband has been calling and texting and coming over to tell me I need to come home because the house is a disaster because his parents won't do anything.  They are in vacation and they are there to see the kids not clean up.  The kids are having a fun time with no rules and he has been contacted by the school because no homework was turned in on Thursday or Friday.  I didn't answer those texts.  I said I would be back after his parents left or he enforced the rules.  He said I was taking it too far and that it was affecting his work.

10ung90,1513,"My daughter (16) and I have gotten into a massive fight. My daughter has always been a picky eater and we have always done our best to accommodate her (Feeding her before parties weddings etc ). The problem lies with my husband's upcoming birthday ( turning 50).The restaurant he has picked is very special to us. That is where we first met as children for a business deal our parents had and then we became best friends when he asked me out in that very restaurant and our first date was there. When he proposed to me and who catered our wedding, I told him I was pregnant and we held my daughter's 1st birthday there. Unfortunately, we couldn’t go there a lot as we had to move for his job but basically, all the major events of our lives were held there. So for my husband's birthday to celebrate him turning half a century old, we want to go there.We once took our daughter there when she was 10 and she hated it. But now since she is 16 I thought she would have matured enough and it is not like I'm forcing her to eat. She has the option of eating at home and I've told her so many times that the restaurant does have food she likes to eat, but she claims that it smells bad. It is a seafood restaurant but we always sit outside at our usual table so I don’t understand that.She says that we are being selfish but I told her it's not about her it's not her day. In anger, she has refused to talk to us and not doing her usual chores and is refusing to eat. My husband is heartbroken and thinks it is all his fault and wants to cancel but I think it will just fuel her brattiness. Today my husband had to work late so it was only my daughter and me. When I called for my daughter to come to eat she looked at the food and then took the plate and dumped it in the bin.I was shocked, food is valuable and she didn’t have to do that. I snapped at her calling her a selfish insecure little brat. That she is not only hurting her father but ruining his birthday and it's not as if we are asking her to give up a kidney. That if she continues this behavior we will never fund her birthday parties ever again. She said that I am a terrible mother for saying that.I feel like I went overboard but that she is acting like a brat. AITA?Edit: I am sorry for the late reply I posted this and went to sleep, No my daughter does not have anything like autism or any food allergies, we tested her when she was 10.We can’t leave her at home because this restaurant is across the country from where we a going to meet our family and according to our country's laws she is still not allowed to be alone for more than a day without parental supervision.We have never had a fight like this and she usually is a chill kid i have no idea what has gotten into her.Edit: The reason we are not too strict with our daughter's eating habits is that we grew up in houses that were verbally and physically abusive, and it affected my husband the most. We never had the chance to go to therapy because at first, it was not a thing then it was too expensive and well we figured we didn’t have to.We did not want our daughter to be like us and we thought if she didn’t cause tantrums who is it really affecting?

10ux79o,598,"So a little backstory, I(24F) and my husband(26M) due to financial struggles, have to live with my parents. We are staying here until I can get a remote job and he can get a better one where we can actually afford to save money to buy a house. We live in a 2 story house with unfortunately only one kitchen which is downstairs. My husband and I along with our children live upstairs and my parents live downstairs. We spend most of the day downstairs because my children enjoy spending time with my mother and she helps me out a lot with them. Anyway, we call the upstairs ‘our house’ and the downstairs ‘their house’. We offered to pay rent/utilities in the past but my father refused to accept any money from us, we insisted a few times but decided to let it go when he wouldn’t budge. My father is a truck driver so he is home every 2 weeks or so. My grandmother from my mother’s side is currently visiting from Europe so there’s a lot of people in the house.We have 2 boys, a 2 and a half year old and a 9 month old. My 9 month old recently started crawling so I decided to get him a playpen for when we are downstairs.When  I wanted to assemble it downstairs but my father told me to go assemble it upstairs cause ‘there’s enough shit here that everyone trips over anyways’.Okay no problem, I went upstairs and assembled it to which my mother got mad because I didn’t assemble it downstairs as she and I discussed it before.My father threw a tantrum because I have so many baby things downstairs, and yes, there was a crib, a bouncer and now there would also be a playpen for the LO.My mother got upset and brought the playpen downstairs to which my father said ‘oh yeah bring more shit here, there’s not enough, with the crib and the bouncer and the toys, yeah why don’t you bring that shit here too?’This hurt me, because in not so many direct words,he basically told me that my sons stuff bothers him, it made me feel like my son’s presence bothers him as well..So I got upset and removed EVERYTHING that was my son’s and brought them upstairs. I was so pissed off about it,because no one ever thinks about my feelings, especially my father, he always says the most hurtful things and doesn’t even care or realize how much his words hurt me..Anyway, a little after I brought everything upstairs, my grandmother came to me and told ME that I don’t know how to act, I am disrespectful towards my father by doing that blah blah. Like, EXCUSE ME? NOW IT’S SOMEHOW MADE TO BE MY FAULT?  I have changed my view of my grandmother after I had kids,my word means nothing when it comes to my children and what I say..the way my father talks to me like I’m a doormat but if I stand up for myself SHE will be the first one to tell me to shut up because I’m “a child” and that I shouldn’t talk back..I am just so done with these people, I’m actually considering moving to my inlaws who live in Germany just to get away.So, reddit, AITA?",AITA for removing every single toy/baby item from my parents house?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ux79o/aita_for_removing_every_single_toybaby_item_from/
10uhg3s,3865,"I (16 genderfluid) was recently at a close relative's wedding with my family (just guests, not as part of the bridal party or anything). The dress code the bride told us (and that was on the invite) was that women wore dresses and men had to wear something similarly formal e.g. a suit.I am AFAB so was told I would have to wear a dress. I don't identify as a woman however, so I wasn't comfortable with this and asked for a potential compromise on my outfit. She insisted that I wore a dress.Cut to when my family were ordering their wedding clothes/figuring out their outfits. My parents asked if I had found anything suitable and I sent them a link to a romper that looks very much like a dress at first glance, it's genuinely not noticeable unless you look closely that the bottom part is not a skirt.We got the romper, it arrives and everything is fine. I wore it to the wedding and for the first part everything seems ok, until I am pulled along too hard by a kid and end up tripping and falling face first, sprawled out on the floor. As everyone nearby gathers around to see what happened, the bride notices that the bottom part of my outfit is shorts and not a skirt, and loses her shit and starts screaming at me that she made it clear I needed to wear a dress and that I was being selfish by going against her wishes on her special day. I'm pretty sensitive and also hate loud noise as I'm autistic, so I start crying because the mix of pain from scraping my leg and her loud voice yelling is enough to overstimulate me pretty badly.

He apologized and brought gifts:\- A new physical copy of my book. Now this needs an explanation: except for me, the only person who has a digital copy of my book is my older sister, Federica. Federica is a No-bullshit kind of person. If the chance of me forgiving Carl were 1 out of 10, the chance of my sister doing the same things were 1 out of 1000. When he told me he convinced my sister to give him a copy to reprint it I was astonished.\- A full collection of figurines of the main cast of my story. There are 5 main characters in the story and only two of them were on the cover I printed, which mean that he read the book and drew/had someone else draw a sketch of the other 3 characters in order to make their figurine. They are 25cm tall and I admit they look really good.\- He paid me back for the physical copy he destroyed. I asked him why he was giving me the money since he had just given me a new copy and his parents had already paid me. He said that the new copy was in place of the one he destroyed, while the money were an apology.He apologized for what he did that day and explained me his reasons ( a mix of jealousy and bad timing) . Things are still not completely fine but they are better. He thanked me for bearing his hobby all these years. I apologized for losing my temper and insulting his hobby. While I don't share his passion over figurines, I can understand how much and love he put in every one of them.He looked sincere in his apology and we parted amicably.I decided to give back to his parents the money they originally gave me as an apology.

Our daughter turns 15 later this month, and we had a birthday party planned for her but in light of recent events, we decided to cancel. Our daughter is friends with some popular mean girls. We are working on things like therapy and consequences. Unfortunately, her latest behavior was the worst yet. Our son is very sweet and hasn’t run into any issues with him being mean yet. Our son met a girl on a cruise we went on in April of last year, the girl lives about 40 minutes away, so they don’t go to the same school. My son and the girl hung out together the whole cruise and started dating soon after.His girlfriend is an absolute sweetheart, very bright and loves sports like my son. The girl is also Indian-American, she was born here and so were her parents but both sides of her family have relatives in India. The girl and her family went to India last month and my son was invited many months ago, we signed all the paperwork needed and he was able to go with them. They came back a few days ago, my son really enjoyed it and brought back souvenirs (some sports stuff) for himself and family members. One of those family members was our 5 year old niece, who is my sister and her husband’s daughter. He had brought handmade dolls for my niece, my sister lives about 5 minutes away, my son sometimes babysits for my sister. They also have a son, which he also got gifts for. The issue is, the day he came back, my sister and husband came over with their son and daughter to get the gifts. My daughter had her friends over, while he was presenting the gifts, our daughter and her friends were in the living room with us, we could hear laughing when he presented the dolls and a few of the girls had their phones out. At the time, my husband and I thought nothing of it, we thought they were on TikTok. My sister, her husband and my husband and I eventually left the house to get food we ordered. We came back, they ate and left.The next day, I got a phone call from my sister saying that her daughter was asking her if the dolls were ugly, and she said my daughter said something about it.

10uj07i,835,"I (19M) visited the zoo today with my family and we were checking out the koalas, who I was especially excited to see. You may not know this, but koalas apparently need over eighteen hours of sleep a day to function or else they can get quite unhealthy quite quickly, and so any exhibit of them at a zoo will often come with an expectation that you maintain a certain level of silence while observing them. This zoo today was no exception - you are made to go through two gates, both of which have signage saying ‘Please be quiet, keep the noise down, silence please, etc’ and then the door to the koala house itself has another sign: ‘Please keep noise levels to a minimum’. With all those reminders, I figured people would get the memo, but as soon as we entered the enclosure (which was a small room indoors with a glass window looking into the koala pen) I spotted a couple in their early thirties with two young kids and a baby. I somewhat apprehensively tried to observe the koalas (they were so cute and my little sister was happy to see them) but then, like clockwork, the baby starts crying. Hardly the baby’s fault - it’s a baby, they cry - so I gave the dad of the family the benefit of the doubt thinking he’d either take the baby out or calm her down. A few moments pass; the baby gets more annoyed and cries louder. The koalas scurry away, hiding in their cubby holes, and others wake up from their sleeping.I give the dad the look. I feel like everyone knows the look - we’ve either had someone give it to us or given it to someone else. I’m not sure I’d ever been on this end of it, but I’d definitely received some looks at times.Baby continues to cry. I (being a socially awkward autistic teenager) grapple with the idea that the dad might have missed my giving him the look so I do the classic: I shake my head and give a little sigh. No change. I throw another look his way - this time a little more firm - but I feel like I overdo it - my eyes are a little too intense, perhaps - because suddenly the dad is saying, in the voice of someone who’s just gotten a lecture ‘Well alright mate, it’s just a baby’ to which I reply with a gesture towards the sign ‘Silence, please’. ‘But it’s a baby!’ he says. ‘Well don’t bring a baby in here’ I reply, in a whisper. My parents jump on me, thinking I’m out of line and the couple and their kids give me the filthiest of looks and leave the enclosure, leaving me feeling very tense.What do we think? I feel like this is a very common struggle in a public place where there aren’t always members of staff to enforce the rules. We want to pick our battles, of course, but this family bringing their baby in spoiled my little sister’s magical moment seeing a koala for the first time. Surely they should’ve seen the signs and thought ‘Probably best to not bring little Charlie in’ or, if they really wanted to see the koalas, the dad could’ve stayed outside with the baby and the mum and the kids could’ve gone in.

10un17c,159,"Backstory, when my daughter ‘Georgia’ was 13, her mother and I divorced. I didn’t want to uproot Georgia, therefore they kept the house and I moved into a nearby apartment. My ex was a SAHM, I continued paying all the bills for two years. Currently, I’m still paying only the mortgage. Georgia is now 17 and resides with her mother. 16 months ago I met my now girlfriend. During that time, I purchased a house to get out of my apartment. My girlfriend moved in a few months back. Prior to that, I introduced her to Georgia. As I expected, she had a very ‘whatever’ attitude. I understand changes such as these are hard for kids to cope with. Since the divorce, Georgia could come and go as she pleased. Since my girlfriend moved in though, Georgia became obnoxious with constantly trying to run her off and humiliate her. The first incident, Georgia came over one afternoon while I was at work to say when she got home from school the previous day, I was coming out of her mother’s bedroom. She knew this was not true as I had been with her that entire day. I sat Georgia down for a serious reality check. Georgia was apparently snooping through our mail, she saw my girlfriend’s DOB. For the record, we’re 13 years apart both divorced with kids. Georgia asked my girlfriend, “So what do you see in my dad, a caregiver?“ One early Saturday morning she came over while we were still sleeping. She had brought empty Depends underwear boxes and stacked them in the living room. When we woke up, Georgia said, “Wow, so you wear Depends just like my grandpa does huh?” Thereafter, Georgia would refer to her only as ‘grams’ or ‘the old hag.’ The next incident, she used our bathroom, said she ‘stunk it up’ and used some ‘old lady smelling cologne’ to mask the odor. It was actually very expensive perfume, Georgia sprayed about 70% of the bottle around the house.The final straw happened last weekend. Georgia came over for breakfast. At some point, she took my phone and sent her mother a message that read, “I can’t stop thinking about you, I want to work things out and get back together.” She deleted the text from my phone. Unbeknownst to me, she had mother’s phone on her. Took a screenshot then deleted the text on her mother’s phone. Tuesday, she sent the screenshot to my girlfriend on her mother’s phone and said, “I’m sorry, I think you need to know.” She then deleted that text as well. This nearly caused her to leave, exactly what Georgia wanted. I immediately changed the locks. Before I could speak with Georgia, she showed up and couldn’t get in. She called, we both were pissed off for different reasons. I told her she’s not welcomed at our house until she has a serious attitude change. Her mother called, said I traumatized Georgia, claimed the text incident was a load of shit that never happened (Georgia admitted it). My ex said to be prepared to pay for her therapy, because she’ll need it after I put some tramp above my own child.",AITA for changing the locks on my daughter?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10un17c/aita_for_changing_the_locks_on_my_daughter/
10ubcp5,1461,"I (f33) have one sibling, an older brother, Dan (m36). Dan and I never had the closest relationship even when we were kids. I can't exactly pinpoint why but it was just the way it was.Our mum was a single mother, and our dad was in prison serving a long sentence, and only got out when I was 17 and Dan was 20.When we were kids, our mum was working two jobs as a housekeeper and as a school lunch lady to make ends neat. We were really broke.As soon as I turned 16, I got a job working in retail to contribute to the household and hopefully save up for university. I was starting to save up quite a sizable amount of money after a year.In that same year, Dan got one of his coworkers pregnant. Shortly after she gave birth, she was hospitalised multiple times with post-partum psychosis and eventually lost all custody of the baby. Dan took custody and so it was me, our mum, Dan and the baby in a two bedroom flat. It was feeling a bit crowded and cluttered and Dan vented to me many times about how he needs to get his own place.Dan was really struggling for money, he was working a minimum wage job and had all the baby expenses to worry about.When I was 17, Dan stole my debit card and bank details, and withdrew all of my savings, which was around £2K. He put my debit card back in my wallet and then left the house with the baby and moved in with his new girlfriend.I felt so betrayed that he would just take something that I worked so hard for.My mum told me I was forbidden from going to the police about it, and told me to just let it go, as Dan is struggling and needed it. When I was old enough to go to university, my dad gave me money to go towards my expenses.I hadn't spoken to Dan since that day and Dan never attempted to speak to me either.Last week my mum tried to sneakily get me and Dan to meet up under the guise that we were just getting a normal dinner at a restaurant and he was in on it. I told them that I don't want to see Dan.Dan told me I need to grow up and I can't hold a grudge over this forever.

He said it's only money and I shouldn't be so materialistic.I told him it's the principle of it, that I'm his little sister and he stole something significant from me.

10unudp,172,"I 23F recently got engaged to “Jim” 25M. We don’t like super extravagant weddings, so we plan to keep things simple and frugal. We received money from our families, but we’re using it for a nice honeymoon and using our own bank accounts for the wedding day.Although the title may make it seem otherwise, my step-mother “Kim” and I have a good relationship. She gave me a hefty amount of money and asked that I use it for a dress. She said she was very poor at the time of her first wedding and didn’t get to wear a beautiful dress on her big day, and it would mean the world for me to get to wear one. I obliged. I wasn’t planning on spending my own money on an expensive dress, but the amount of money she gave me the opportunity to wear my dream dress. She even took me dress shopping along with my grandmother and helped me pick the most perfect dress. It was a classic fit and flare, and with all the money I was able to get some custom embroidery done. Not only was it a beautiful dress, but it flattered my body perfectly.A few days after I picked out the dress, however, Kim approached me and asked me if I would like to wear her mother’s old wedding dress from the 1970s, and said she’d give me twice the money she had initially offered to do whatever I pleased with if I agreed. I turned her down. I know it’s a lot of money, but the wedding will be a day I remember for the rest of my life and I really wanted to wear a dress that suits me. The dress in question was puffy with no shape–it would be like getting married in a down jacket.When I said no, Kim explained that she sent me a photo of me in the dress to my step-sister “Bea” 25F and Bea had a freakout and said she wouldn’t come to my wedding if I wore that dress. Some background on Bea: our relationship was strained from the beginning. I had better grades than her, dated better looking guys, went to a more prestigious college, got a higher paying job, and I’m now getting married to the guy we both liked in high school while she is still single. Plus, Bea is overweight and very insecure about how she looks, and has always taken out her insecurities on me. Kim said watching me get married to Jim would be hard enough, and I didn't need to wear a dress like that and make it worse. I still refused to wear the old dress. I told her I’m not going to compromise my wedding to coddle Bea’s insecurities. She then asked for her money back and I said no, she gave me the money and the dress is already paid for.I left it at that but then I got a call from my dad telling me I was rude to Kim and Bea and that I should be able to compromise a small thing about an otherwise perfect wedding for Bea’s sake, or at least pay Kim back the money for the dress. I *did* give her back the leftover money, which was a couple hundred dollars, but I refuse to give back the money I spent on my dress, or wear a different dress.

10u8muo,2932,"I (25F) am getting married in September. My husband, Mike and I are doing a big wedding for 250 guests. I've always dreamed of having a storybook wedding. I asked my best friend Marissa (25F) to be my MOH and she happily agreed. She's been a huge help to me in every step of planning the wedding. Marissa is in a poly relationship and she has 3 partners. Greg (24M), Brandon (27M) and Ace (22NB). She's been with Greg for 5 years and was the first partner she had. They added Brandon and Ace over the course of their relationship with Ace being the newest member. They all date each other and seem to be happy. I don't really ""get"" it if I'm being honest but it's not my business. However the issue came into play when Mike (32M) pulled me aside and said while he loves Marissa he didn't feel like spending the wedding explaining her love life to his family. Which I understand, they are very conservative and hardly accept LGBT people as is let alone a LGBT polyset. I had already reserved 4 spots of Marissa &amp; co but my husband suggested he invite a few coworkers to take the partners spot and Marissa could come alone. I didn't want to ruin his big day so I agreed reluctantly. I know I should have told Marissa from the get go but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. So when invite went out she called me up immediately and asked why she didn't have a plus 3 invite. I explained to her exactly what I said above and she just said ""oh"" and hung up. Next thing I know Brandon is calling me and begging me to reconsider saying they promise they won't act like they are in a relationship but they want to be there for me. Except I can hear Greg in the background telling him tell me to fuck off and that I'm am asshole and he doesn't even want to go. I explain to Brandon that I already gave their ""spots"" to Mike's coworkers. Brandon says okay thank you and hangs up. Marissa texts me the next day saying she isn't coming unless they can go. Mike said he can't uninvite his co-workers now so it's not his problem. I told him I would add them and pay the costs and he just said if I want to spend the whole time explaining their relationship to people than so be it but he isn't wasting his time doing it and will just send people my way. Our other friends think I'm an asshole but Mike's friend and a few of my non mutual friends don't think i am. Just want some more unbiased opinions.Edit: I am the asshole, that's for sure. I followed a lot of advice in this post and asked Mike what he thinks in the morning. He said to talk to Marissa first and see what she wants and we'll make it work. I also had him read over the post himself and he said that a lot of the comments opened his eyes on how he himself was coming off. So we both decided to call Marissa together and beg for forgiveness. We called her and she was happy to talk. We explained our side of things but acknowledged that it was a massive fuck up and could have been handled so much better. We invited her and her partners, obviously and said we would be happy to whatever it takes to have them forgive us. She asked her partners about it and Brandon and Greg both agreed they would prefer to just ""split"" the set up. So Greg and Marissa would be a couple for the wedding and Brandon and Ace would be a couple. They however would need to talk to Ace first (they were at work) and that they would get back to me. So that's where we currently stand.Edit2: I never told Marissa I was inviting her partners, I just had a list of invites with Mike. I'm still the asshole but wanted to explain that.Last edit: Ace got out of work a few hours ago and we all got on speaker phone and had a long conversation with this post pulled up. The crew was all happy to be defended but did think people went a little harder than they would have even Greg. He actually laughed at me calling him self absorbed because he is lol. Anyway. We're all good :) they are coming. They gave permission to tell Mike's parents. We called them after and they understood but said don't let Nanni know or she'll be asking questions all night.

Until my oldest, my daughter, brought it up at a meeting with her counselor that it made her feel bad that I called her names like that.  So I stopped.  I talked to my sons and they both were fine with it.  Sometimes when I call out ""boy"" they yell back ""me boy or him boy""?  But since that meeting I have never referred to my daughter by anything other than her name.  Other than that our relationship has not changed.

TL;DR I'm doing well but it's been a long couple of months![To the people who said Polly was lying about booking a flight because it seemed suspiciously cheap/she could've cancelled within 24 hours - she booked on a cheap UK airline and this is fairly standard pricing, plus their cancellation/refund policies are what you'd expect from an airline where they charge you extra just to sit next to the person you booked with! She's many things but not a total liar, she definitely booked after I told her not to.]After everything blew up with Polly, we didn't speak for a couple of weeks. I talked it over with my parents and they said that I was under absolutely no obligation to pay her a penny, which I agree with, as did all of this sub! However they suggested that I could offer to pay a small amount (like 20% of the fare) in the interests of salvaging the friendship. I liked this idea as I was still feeling so heartbroken and didn't want to throw away 10+ years of friendship if avoidable. So I sent her a message explaining that I didn't feel I owed her any money for her mistake, but that I really cared about her and our friendship and that I would be willing to make a small contribution if it meant that we could meet on happier terms in the future and resume our friendship.Well, she left me on read. For OVER A MONTH. She did eventually reply to tell me that I should still pay the full fare (claiming she was ""seconds away from booking"" when I originally spoke to her), and then messaged me a ""reminder"" of this a few days later. That second day was my birthday and she sent me no well wishes along with it, just a reminder that she wanted money. I'd finally been pushed over the edge, I was absolutely raging and told her it was unacceptable to message me shit like this on my birthday. That was the last time we spoke and I've now blocked her on everything.It also turns out she didn't tell as many of our mutual friends as I thought. One of them is no longer speaking to me, I've tried to reach out but she's ignoring me, so I'm leaving it because who needs people like that. Another pair had heard the story and said they want to ""remain neutral"", which makes me think they didn't hear the whole truth, but I can't be bothered to push it as they're still cool with me and don't really care about the Polly drama.I'm feeling great now, things are going well with my family and I am really enjoying my last few months of semester abroad, I've made some good friends and am having the best time.

10uj3o1,181,"My husband and I own a small hobby farm. It is just over an acre. We have a 4 stall barn, large chicken coop, and a shelter for my 3 sheep. I have 3 horses and I rent out 1 stall to my friends friend. This boarder brought me a very sick horse that I nursed back to health. I forced her to take care of some much needed veterinary things on the horse which saved its life. I am of the mind set that it is our responsibility to fix things before they become a problem. She is essentially a single mother with 4 kids and waits until things are really broken before she reacts. In other words, she has way different views of the world than I do. I am always expecting things to end up sideways in a bad way so fix things that look even a little fishy as a horse vet bill is never lower than $500. She waits until it must be taken care of before she reacts. She asked me if she could give kids lessons on my property to pay for things. I said sure as long as she had insurance to cover both my home and her. She also, could not let her students be alone on my property, and she had to keep everything picked up.Well, her under age students are being dropped off 60-45 minutes before she even shows up to play on my property. Things like brushes, tools, and saddles are left out all over. I reminded her about these things and she said she would fix it. My husband then asked if she really had insurance. I then asked her for proof of her insurance. She did not have any.I am pissed because she is leaving us vulnerable to a law suit and the possibility of loosing our home. I called my insurance company to make sure we were covered in the mean time, then asked the horse community what insurance she and I would need to make sure we don’t lose our home if one of her students gets hurt. In the meantime, I asked her to stop lessons, or get insurance, or leave by March 1st.

Let's call him Gray. It may not be something too deep so I was flattered. i let him know i wasn't interested since i just got out of a long relationship.A month after this rejection Gray asked me to be his girlfriend. Again, i rejected. He said it's cool, but he'd appreciate it if i didn't cut him off. I didn't, as he was a nice friend to have. I had to reiterate to him more than once after this that there is no chance i'm reciprocating the feelings at all.One day one of my closer coworkers let me know that Gray would ask her what my plans for the day were, and if i had any he'd ask where i'd be going and who i'd be with. He'd also ask her if i was hanging around any other male coworkers.One time when we were out for a lunch with the team, our boss gave us the rest of the day off. that meant we'd be free to go home or hang out after lunch. I told everyone i'd be off home as i was too tired. He offered to bring me home and i declined. He snapped and started almost begging to bring me home but i just kept declining. He then said fine let me book you a taxi home and proceeded to type my address correctly when i know for a fact i never gave him my address. I was majorly uncomfortable at this point.He's done weirder things over the past year - stalking my family on social media, memorizing usernames of my close friends on ig, he even found an old twt acc i wasn't using anymore, ship products he bought online directly to my address, even got on a taxi and followed mine home. When i confronted him about it he said he just wanted to make sure i was safe.Last week while preparing to go home it started to rain so he insisted to bring me home on his motorcycle. he followed me around the office just going ""please let me bring you home"". we were around other coworkers but i snapped at him and told him to f off and leave me alone in a rather high voice. a coworker (who was aware of the stories i told above) overheard and told me i didn't have to react that way. i talked to a (non coworker) friend about it and he told me this might be gray's way of ""winning me over"". now i'm worried that i'm just viewing him as annoying and stalker-ish bc i didn't reciprocate the feelings and went off on him when he was being kind.

10usuqe,228,"A little background: I am the proud (future) step dad of a 6 and 5 year old. I am engaged and getting married in a couple of months. I have known the kids and dated my fiancé since our 5 year old was 1. Over two years ago the kids moved in with me and live with me and my fiancee full time. their dad only sees them about once every month. The kids go to school in our boundary school, and my fiancée has primary placement. Between me and my fiancee we have taken on all of the responsibilities to raising our kids and their dad contributes nothing. Their dad has an open invitation to come pickup the kids every Sunday. However, we hardly hear from him and he does not see them as often as we would like.The part where I am wondering if AITA: on the days he wants to see the kids, he comes to pick them up. Every time, he knocks on our front door, and then comes inside even though the kids are fully ready to go shoes on and everything. He usually spends 5-10 minutes talking in the foyer and then they go on their way. When he returns with the kids, it is essentially the same thing, except he stands in the foyer and gives a long drawn out, emotional goodbye. He doesn’t try to move things along and it’s awkward to me that I have to be the one to encourage the kids to “say goodbye” and move on with our day and allow him to leave. Occasionally the kids want to bring him upstairs and show them a new toy or something in their bedroom. I am uncomfortable with this. I don’t like the idea of my fiancées ex coming into my house and in personal areas such as our upstairs. I vocalized to my fiancée this and she agrees, but she doesn’t want to make things in unnecessarily difficult for the kids so has taken no action on it. I understand. But…The other day, after he dropped of the kids, after another long drawn out goodbye, I told the kids to head upstairs and get their pajamas on. I walked outside with their dad and suggested that instead of him coming inside every time that he say all of his goodbyes from the car. I said this with good intentions and implying that he deserves a good, and private goodbye with his kids without me or my fiancé lingering around. I suggested once he is done with his good bye, the kids can walk up to the steps and wave when they get inside. To me this makes things easier on everyone and I don’t have to have my personal boundaries violated.

10urxf5,362,"I (32F) am getting married in September. We have started to get stationary orders together and we’ve run into an issue that has our families split. My fiancé (34M) and I are not very traditional, and our wedding is going to have some unorthodox aspects. In addition to an open bar we’re also doing a cannabis bar, and the desserts are coming from a vegan bakery (we’re not vegan, we just like this bakery). My parents are quite conservative and his are less so but still lean towards that end.The issue is that I want to include a note with the invitations asking people not to wear pastel colors to the wedding. My bridal party is wearing pastels (they were able to choose their own dresses/outfits) and my wedding dress is blush pink. The tradition is that you don’t wear white to a wedding, but I don’t really want someone to show up and accidentally match my or my attendants’ clothes because they were avoiding white. My fiancé doesn’t know that my dress is pink but he was fine when I explained about the bridal party. Both of our sibling groups also thought it was a good idea.His parents were not enthusiastic about it and my parents were downright offended. His mom basically told us we can do whatever we want but we’re going to look incredibly rude for dictation what people wear to our wedding as guests. My mother screamed at me and called me an entitled brat. She said with the type of wedding we’re having we have no right to ask anything of our guests, and we “should just be thankful people are coming because no one wants to smell dope at a wedding reception.” When I told her my dress wasn’t white she yelled at me about that too and then kicked me out of her house.I’ve been rethinking the entire wedding. My fiancé and I are cannabis enthusiasts and he runs a dispensary, but I can see how maybe some people won’t enjoy that aspect so maybe my mom is right and we shouldn’t have it. It would make me sad but I think I understand. I also am second guessing my choice of dress. My mom wasn’t there when I chose it and she would have had a problem with it (kind of why I didn’t invite her to come in the first place) but maybe she’s right. It’s not a black tie affair so maybe I shouldn’t ask people to wear specific things.WIBTA?Edit: For those asking, yes the wedding is explicitly child free. No one under the age of 21 will be allowed into the event and we have already contracted a security guard to enforce this. Also, we are well aware that many people will not want to attend and we are fine with that. Most of my family lives on the other side of the country and we are planning a bbq next summer to celebrate with them. We expect about 40 people (our friends and some of his family) to attend and they are all cannabis-friendly.The wedding is being held on our property and all of the cannabis will be kept and consumed outside. There will not be edibles available, and all of this will be be explained on the invitations.Also this is the text that we wanted to put on the invitations about the dress code:“As you know, we have always enjoyed things that are outside of tradition. As such, you may see the bridal party incorporate some non-traditional colors for the ceremony, and we’re asking guests to please avoid wearing light pastel colors.”",WIBTA for including a note about dress code with wedding invitations,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10urxf5/wibta_for_including_a_note_about_dress_code_with/
10uwunk,120,"I (26F) have a 18 month old with my ex-partner (33M). We were together for two years when I found out I was pregnant. It was unplanned and I was hesitant because I didn't think we were ready to be parents. I wanted kids but I work in a field I had to train in for years, my job is super stressful and tiring, and at the time I got pregnant I'd just moved up but still wasn't making a huge amount of money and needed to carry on putting in a lot of work to progress further. He was the opposite and really excited and wanted us to start a family and we basically talked it through and (naively) I changed my mind based on his reaction.His job is kind of intense and at times dangerous and takes him out of the country for a few months at a time regularly. When I was 16 weeks pregnant he went away for work and was gone for three months. We'd text and call whenever he was able to but a few weeks into him being away he stopped answering my texts and would keep calls super short. I thought something bad happened in his work situation and chalked it up to that. When he got back he was completely off and we started bickering a lot about small things. At this point I was 7 months pregnant, experiencing pregnancy complications, and becoming really dependant on him. Just over a month before my due date he told me he couldn't do this anymore and left, went no-contact with me. I had the baby by myself, my mum and sister helped me out a lot and still do but I've been my son's primary caregiver this entire time.A few months ago he got in contact with me to talk and explain himself. I wasn't trying to be difficult or petty, but I said no because I just wasn't in the right mind space to see him because I think I honestly kind of processed everything by reacting like he'd died and hadn't been thinking of him as a person who was still existing somewhere. After that he showed up at my mum's house, my mum is extremely nice so she heard him out. She said he just wanted to meet the baby and talk things out with me. I felt guilty being the reason they couldn't meet so I said ok and he's been spending time with him semi-regularly since. Last week he told me he's going away for work for a few months again and wants to have the baby stay with him over the weekend before he goes. I said no because I don't know anything about my ex's home environment, I've never been away from my son overnight since he was born, and my ex has never had to look after him by himself before so I don't know what it would be like for him.I told him this but he said I'm just using my son to punish him by keeping them apart and that he isn't a pawn for me to use in my revenge game. I know it's wrong to let bad feelings between parents seep into kid's lives, and as much as I have my valid reasons for not letting him stay over I'm worried that I'm being too untrusting and deep down I'm letting our issues make decisions regarding my son's relationship with his dad.

After we chose our dates, my mom informed me that she had invited two other members of our family along with her best friend and her adult daughter (Kelly and Stacy) to come on the trip with us. Initially, I was fine with this plan, although I was admittedly a little hurt because I wanted this to be a special time for us but I didn’t say anything. My family’s had a tough time this last year, so if inviting more people makes my mom happy, then fine. I went ahead and planned my travel and chose corresponding flights (connecting with mine) for my mom and anyone else leaving from her state. I’m a very relaxed traveler, I’m not big on tourist sites or itineraries, and typically like to make travel plans and then go with the flow once I get to the destination. Last night, we had a call to discuss the trip and I felt like Stacy was being a bit overbearing in the conversation, suggesting that others fly out of an airport closer to her state (makes no sense as most are on the US East Coast and she is more inland) and that we look into working with a travel agent overall. I’m a frequent traveler and more than capable of planning a weekend in a city I’ve visited before, but after this phone call, I just kind of see things a spiraling out of control. What was supposed to be a relaxing long weekend with my mom is quickly turning into an unwieldy group-trip tourism monstrosity with an itinerary that just doesn’t feel very fun for me. At this point, I’m the only one who has booked a plane ticket, and I am planning to sit my mom down and tell her I’ve changed my mind and no longer want to go on the trip with all these people. I’m hoping that since it’s so far away, people will be willing to pivot, perhaps to a trip closer to home at another time. I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings or my mom’s relationship with Kelly, but I just am not willing to spend this amount of time and money planning a trip where I know there is high potential for me to not have a good time.

10ui2ji,419,"Hi all,So I live in a block of 9 flats, and have lived here for about 5 years. The flats themselves are around 7 years old.I'm lucky enough to own my flat, and the block itself is a mixture of renters and owners. The flats are however, all leasehold.Every flat has a similar layout. They have two beds, with a main bathroom, and one ensuite. The living room and kitchen are open plan. Each flat has two assigned parking spaces.Now in the current climate (UK based), the flats aren't selling too well despite being in a very desirable area of London. One of our neighbours who owns his flat, has therefore decided to rent it out so that he can move to a larger property. My issue is, he has decided he wants to maximise his profit and to do this he has converted the living room into a third bedroom.This doesn't sit well with me at all and I'm pretty sure he can't legally do it. Firstly, I think it's pretty shitty to convert the living room and leave the renters with one small kitchen as the only communal space. I really don't like the idea of him maximising his profit at others expense and creating overcrowding. Secondly, this is a block full of couples and families. I'm concerned that if more and more people start doing this it changes the demographic. Then there's just the issues of having multiple people In one flat. More cars which the block doesn't have space for, more noise from the occupants etc etc.He has managed to successfully get some renters as the rental market is booming but they haven't moved in yet. I'm very tempted to make some enquiries to the freeholder and the council about his set up, but if it is illegal (which I strongly suspect it is) then I'd not only lose this guy his renters, but he'd have to put everything back at expense.

I pulled out my headphones immediately and asked what was wrong and he started shouting at me for ignoring him. I apologized and said I couldn’t hear him due to the music. I noticed that 4 of the 6 dogs in this group were going a bit bonkers, barking and trying to pull away from their owners, and the older gentleman started telling me how it was my fault and I was winding the dogs up and the same thing had happened last week. I said that it wasn’t my intention and that I was just trying to exercise. He told me to exercise elsewhere. I said that this was the closest place to do it to my home and I’m free to exercise when I want.

10uag1t,160,"I(42M) have 6 siblings and this is about our youngest(32M).My other siblings are also older than me, the oldest being 49.We lost our dad to brain cancer when my brother was 13. This devastated him and left really deep scars. He was really unstable at middle+ high school and mom was also severely depressed and none of us were living in our hometown so we couldn't handle everything as we should but he managed to enter into one of the best universities in our country. After he got into the university, he started to be in the relationships with older guys. He was in the same city with me at this time, so I had the chance to have an eye on him. He wasn't in any bodily or academically harmed but all of this fucked him up really badly mentally and he was a mess until he met with Liam 11 years ago (53M).He was a widower(he lost his husband at 2010) and my brother fell in love with him instantly. He took him under his wings, protected him and nurtured him. I was also suspicious of their relationship first but as the time passed, I saw the realness ,the authenticity, the loyality, the love. My brother was happy but the other family members never approved this relationship, accused Liam of being a predator so he got C&amp;D orders for harassment and I was the only one with my family(my 4 year old was a flower girl) in their wedding in 2018 other than our mother, who had dementia at that time and we lost her the next year. I also cut my siblings out of our lives after our moms funeral.At the beginning of 2021,we learned my brother had cancer, the same one with our father. He was early diagnosed and had the surgery but it returned 18 months later and spread fast. Chemo didn't work and at Christmas Eve, he gave his final breath while we were there.My brother asked his funeral to be organized as we seem fit and said ""please don't do anything will make you uncomfortable for anyone."" We didn't invite our siblings. Liam's family and my ILs were there but no one from my family was invited,they learned my brother's death after his death was announced at our home towns facebook page. My siblings were mad and they tried to reach Liam via his lawyer but they couldn't so they reached out to me.I told them they deserved this after all they did and they should be glad we are not charging them with harassment with the heat of the moment but after time passed,I feel really guilty about saying this.

10uqfvz,115,"My wife and I both like our space and privacy.  Me more than her.  To that end, we both have our own full bathrooms.One of my biggest pet peeves about living with my wife is that she legitimately does not *see* the messes she makes. I can overlook this in most areas except water.  If she turns on a faucet anywhere, going behind her is like following a dog that violently shook itself off.  Every time she takes a shower, she leaves 10-15 feet worth of soggy footprints and drips everywhere she's been.  I have slipped in her wake more than once.This is why I *can't* share a bathroom with her.The issue is that she will use whatever bathroom is closest, which is often mine.  I *never* use hers, but I usually just shrug it off because I'm not the potty police.  However, every time she washes her hands, she leaves a mess.I have told her multiple times to please not splash water everywhere.  She will apologize, then continue to do it.  I know she's not doing it intentionally.  I know she doesn't *see* it.  But it has to stop.Today, I went into the bathroom behind her and stepped in a puddle.  There was another puddle on the countertop that was dripping onto the rug.  The mirror was splashed with water literally up to my eye level.  My toothbrush was wet.  The tissue box was wet.  There was a mass of soap foam in the sink.  All because she had washed her face.I called her into the bathroom and told her that if she can't not do this, she can't use my bathroom.She got upset and said she wouldn't use it anymore.1.  I don't believe her.  I think she'll just forget and keep using it.2.  I seriously wouldn't mind if she didn't leave a water hazard behind her, but she's made it clear that she cannot abide by that.3. If I asked her to clean it up, she would, but she would not do it to my standards, because *she cannot see the mess*.

She started making acid comments towards my work, and how I am just a rip-off and a scammer, because I work multiple fields, it angered me but whatever, I was too busy to bicker aroundWhen time to leave rolled up, she took me aside and started berating me, saying I should stop scamming people, and lying to my family about what I do, saying my work is just a ruse and implying I sell drugs or have an OF (I love the idea), she ended up calling me a mercenary and laughing at me. I felt so bad and after leaving I told my parents, minus the mercenary bit, which I only shared with my BF, my parents were angry because I bought dinner and Emily ate and everything but still insulted me, so they called Aunt Sarah and said we were not attending this week.The rest of the family started begging us to attend, Aunt Sarah said I didn't even have to bring food, she would cook something, and apologized a lot, but Emily didn't, so my parents decided we should go and just ignore Emily if she started at it again.However, my BF loved the ""mercenary"" idea, and went out of his way to design a crop top for me, featuring my favorite comic character, which happens to be a 1920's hitman cat, he also added the words ""Too busy being a mercenary, you can f*ck off"" to the design and printed it for me, I loved it, and my parents, who also love that comic, and not knowing about the mercenary thing, loved it too, so they suggested I wore it for today's gathering as it looks really, really cool, I did, because I see nothing wrong with it?, however when we arrived and Emily saw my crop top, she started crying??, and started saying I was so bitter and spiteful, and that she was ready to apologize to me but my crop top was offensiveI had to explain everyone the whole ordeal and it was embarrasing, my parents scolded me for not telling them what the design was created for, but sided with me, however a few cousins say I'm an AH because Emily wanted to apologize and my rude t-shirt offended her, one of them suggested I post here, AITA?","AITA for wearing an ""offensive"" crop top to our family gathering?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10un8lv/aita_for_wearing_an_offensive_crop_top_to_our/

Fast forward to this year, with constant comments about his speech being ""delayed"", she's called him chubby, told me to watch what he eats, and also asked me ""why does he sound like an autistic kid?"" when he was whining during a phone call. For the record, he isn't autistic and does not technically have a speech delay.Side note: she has another friend that has helped her during times we weren't speaking, fully due to her own behavior and past abusive outbursts towards me, and she has informed me she'll be naming the baby after her. Personally I don't care, but why tell me? to hurt my feelings?Now we're at the invitations for her baby shower; something else she didn't even think to do with me, I didn't have one, and she asked me to fly out for that.

When they had the 2 year old my fiance was not told until his wife was 5 months pregnant, and was told she could not be there for the birth(this was a home birth, not a hospital so it was an option) and was nit allowed to visit until the baby was almost a month old.

She knows this is BS because they spend a ton of money constantly. She knows this is all coming from his wife, and she is basically trying to cut her out.

I mentioned it to my husband a couple of weeks ago and told him he was more than welcome to come. He said he didn’t want to and got grumpy reminding me he didn’t want to rock climb anymore. I didn’t mention it again until today when I reminded him that the trip was next week and I was planning on going.

10ux1bx,48,"My boyfriend (M34) has a 6yo daughter. I (F33) have a 5yo son. We live together and have my son 50% of the time and his daughter every other weekend as she lives out of town. We both forgot it was a public holiday this Monday which meant we would have his daughter Sunday night when usually we would not.My 3 friends and I made plans for Sunday night that were important to me and them, 3 weeks prior. I would not have my son, and his daughter would be back at her house with her mum, so I would be free to make plans (so I thought). It was only a dinner, but its very difficult for the 4 of us to get together alone, hence why it was planned so far in advance.Sunday morning, my bf wakes up ill: a stomach bug. He stayed in bed all day while I looked after both kids. I made sure he was left alone so he could sleep. Mid afternoon I asked if he would be well enough to look after his daughter that night, as I was taking my son back to his Dads, and i wouldn't be home. He initially says yes, but then later on he makes it pretty clear he is very unwell and its likely gastro.I suggested he organise for his daughter to go home then, as a) its friggin contagious and b) if its gastro he'd still be out for the count Monday and I'd be on duty to take care of her while I work (I WFH and don't get the day off), and likely have to drive her to her mum on Monday. I even offered to drive her back the whole way on Sunday afternoon instead of her mum needing to come meet us halfway as she usually does.He is angry that I would suggest that, as his time with her is extremely limited as it is since the mother moved out of town with his daughter. He said he might be feeling okay Monday and then still get to spend the day with her and didn't want to risk losing that day with her, which I do understand. But there was an expectation from him that I cancel my plans and stay to look after her because he is sick and needed my help.I offered him an alternative - if he's too sick to take care of her, I will take her home so you don't have to, and so I can keep my plans. We had an argument, I said (quite angrily) that his daughter isn't my responsibility, and so I left and went to my dinner. He was angry, I was angry. We absolutely do not see eye to eye on this. If I were in dire straights and he had plans, I'd organise for my sons father to have him as i wouldnt EXPECT my partner to take responsibility here, but it is different as I see my son whenever I want and have him far more often.

10v4ioa,25,I met my wife on tinder about nine years ago.  I was in university and she was working.  We both met a few people on the app. When we decided that we were going to be exclusive we both deleted it together.  It was a way of commiting to each other.  I know it's weird.  She still doesn't like that I used it to hook up with girls before we were exclusive.  She isn't exactly innocent in this regard but she says it's different because she dated the other guys and didn't just hook up.  Whatever.  Four years ago her father passed away in a motorcycle accident.  It was very sad as he was still pretty young and healthy.  She has had a hard time dealing with it and is still grieving pretty hard.  I don't really get it but I do my best to be there for her.  The problem is that she gets triggered by anyone cheating on a tv show or movie.  And the same goes for a father dying.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a show or movie without that?  She lost her shit at the theater when I took her and the kid to see Encanto.  She cried for a week when Marshall's dad died on How I Met Your Mother. Spoiler alert for a show that's been over for nine years by the way.  So I've been making extra time for myself to watch movies and shows that have that in it.  I get up early and make breakfast for everyone.  Get the kid his lunch ready and then start work early.  I usually finish up my work an hour or so before the end of my day.  Then I stay in my office and and watch an hour of something I want to watch.  Then I come out and do my part of the housework and spend time with her and the kid.  On the weekends I spend time with them and depending on the weather we might end up playing games or watching tv in the house.  If it's nicer out we spend time outdoors.  Unfortunately she caught me.  We had friends over and they mentioned seeing a recent movie in the MCU.  After they left she asked me when I saw the movie we were talking about.  She knows we didn't see it in the theater and we have not watched it on Disney+. So I told her I watched it little by little in the office.

I have always made sure she has plenty of time to herself. We budget for her to get girls nights. Spa days.  Massages. Lunches out with friends.  I do a lot less socializing than she does.  I like tv and movies and that's how I want to use what little time I can carve out for myself. She says I'm being selfish. And that I cannot understand why she feels the way she does about cheating.

I’m ginger and ofc very pale, and can’t be on direct sun for long. But my aunt wanted to get a spot in direct sun, cause she wanted to sunbath, I agreed cause I didn’t want to sound ungrateful for paid vacation.

I wasn’t feeling good, cause I’ve spent whole afternoon in direct sun but again, my mouth was shuted. Just told them I’m feeling little bit dizzy.

I’ve started asking if we just can’t go back to the hotel, cause I’m really feeling unwell. They didn’t really care cause they said “I’m adult, I can do it”. I mean I was this close 👌🏻 to fainting. But they were like “Have at least one shot, it will raise your blood pressure.” When I actually started to go even more pale, that it really looked unhealthy, and weak in general they finally, after my begging, took me to the hotel. At hotel my head was spinning like never. I knew that, if I had the oppoturnity to lie down sooner my bp would stable itself and I would be okay instead of trying to go over it by pushing myself over my limits.The next day was terrible, I was so weak, felt like I will throw up everything if I ate. They didn’t want me to stay alone in the hotel room, so I had to go, with them to see monuments. I was so quiet about feeling unwell but when it became unbearable I told them and they said I made it up cause I looked fine to this moment. My sis and aunt had lunch and uncle took me back to hotel.

I felt so bad that the next day, having fever, quick breath and other symptoms of heatstroke but they still left me at the room because they were on vacation and (this is my aunts words) “they won’t let me ruin it”. In the evening I got so bad, that my other uncle picked me up and drove home.I think I should mention that this brought my anxiety back, along with hypochondria, and I had to go through that terrible process of starting the new antidepressants again, just because they made drinking their priority. It’s an old story. But every morning when I have to take the antidepressants, I think about it.",AITA who ruined the vacation?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uq9jx/aita_who_ruined_the_vacation/

My father is a pastor and since I was little it was what was taught and drilled into me.Now that I'm older I just don't want to go anymore, things have happened to kind of make me want to distance myself and figure things out for me. I've vocalize how I don't want to go to my dad many times but each time it turns into him yelling at me about how I need to read my Bible and how I need this and brings up ""mistakes"" I've made. Or he'll go off on a rant about how I'm selfish and ungrateful because I don't want to do this one thing but want him to do things for me even tho he ""legally"" doesn't have to. When he says that he usually lists things like feed my siblings and I, taking us to school, stuff like that. And I mean yea he doesn't have to do that he could of not had us or given us up but since he didn't, we'll then yes legally he has to feed us. I'm 20 so I've been trying to buy my own groceries and do my own thing but even then he goes off at me about how we're a family and I can't buy food for only myself.

So to go to the bank I'd have to catch the bus, I have a bus pass that he again has access and puts exact money on so when I say I'm going here he puts the exact amount needed and if it comes up short or not right I'm busted.I haven't mentioned my mo, she's in the picture still married and live together but she's much worse.

10uv0pc,66,"My S/O and i have been living together since 2016. Since then I have paid for all of the utilities, the mortgage, property tax, home owners insurance, groceries, etc. I've only ever asked her to pay for 2 things: her own debt, and our vet bills (we have 2 dogs).She doesn't make much money and has had no less than 10k in credit card debt since we've met. In the time that we've been together her credit card debt has actually increased by several thousand. But she has been fully employed ($15/h) the entire time we've known each other.I've been nagging her for years to get her spending in check so we can have a fighting chance at a reasonable life in which I'm not breaking my back for us to survive. Recently, her car shit the bed and she had precisely $0 in her bank account to get a new one. She also has a 500ish credit score (700 when we met). So i bought a beater for $4k so she had something that would roll to work and back while she saves for something of her own. Thus far the car has cost me around $6500 after fuel, insurance, and taxes.Even though she doesn't make much money, it literally cost her nothing to live. Her food, housing, utilities, insurance etc are covered. So this means she has the ability to save around 400-500 a month to fix her own situation. She has yet to do it and at this point I'm questioning whether or not this relationship is a lost cause. I feel like it's been 7 years that I've been paying her way and she has 400 dollars to her name. How can i rely on her in any situation where I'm out of work? If i end up in an accident or come down with a serious illness there is absolutely no plan b. Ill just be injured/sick AND lose my house. She also potentially wants kids but in my mind, if she can't save $10 how can i trust her with my child? Long story short, she costs me thousands in unnecessary expenses every year because she won't grow up and take care of her own financial problems.  This leads me to lecturing her and inevitably making her cry and her playing victim while dragging out every excuse in the book to justify why she CAN'T help her own situation.Now I've stated the bad, let's look at the good. She's fiercely loyal, generally sweet, genuinely a good person and she puts up with a lot of my own shortfalls.I'm strongly considering leaving her though because every year that she doesn't get her shit together costs me 10k+ of my retirement savings. We're up to at least 70k so far. Am I the dick head for telling her that I'm done with it? I do love her, but i feel like she is actively sabotaging the life that I've worked 70+ hours a week to build for us for nearly the last decade.",AITA for forcing my S/O to grow up,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uv0pc/aita_for_forcing_my_so_to_grow_up/
10v2gv2,27,"So my ex and I have a 5 year old, when our son was 6 months she seperated (the character limit doesnt let me elaborate).After a while she didnt allow me to see my child. So i went to a lawyer who recommended to go to court.In this process she started to make up lies about me to make me look bad infront of a judge, so I had to have court odered supervised visits with my child for 6 months for an evaluation of my relationship to my son.After 6 months a court date was in order, for a decision.3 days before the court date i got notified, that my ex disapeared with our son, location unknown.At that point i stopped sending money.For 3 months I had no idea where they are, to then find out that they are in a different country.After some emails, she told me i could fly there and visit our son.So i did.While I was in that country she told me that she was pregnant and that they want to stay there and if I tell the court back home that everything is resolved, i could fly there every two weeks. (She apparently got an abortion later)I agreed, told my lawyer and visited theree time until the paperwork with the court was settled.Once that was done, she blocked me and didnt allow another visit…I got news that her parents had to tell me that the situation was very bad, my ex and new partner were engaged in domestic issues.I startet pressure in that country with a lawyer and all.2 months after, things got so bad, that my ex came back to our home town.A couple weeks after, my ex got into a clinic because of depression. I brought our son to visit and tried to support.Our son mostly lived with me, because the court gave me sole custody.After a couple of months I offered her to have shared custody and she happily agreed so i did the paperwork.She doesnt work and cant find a job she likes, because she doesnt want to do a job that makes her unhappy.So i provided financial support basically for everything. Gave her money for an appartment, bought everything she needs in the appartment, paid rent for a couple of months. We even had some intimate moments, which was really confusing.Everything else got kind of normal, day care, divided the time where our son is with me or with her.A couple days ago she told me, that she had to look after our son for the most time alone in the past and that if I am such a great father its my turn now. That I am not a team partner, she cant trust me, and a list of things I apparently did wrong and that its my fault that she went to a clinic.At which point i was done if I am not appreciated. Said, that yes, I certainly made mistakes but so did she and that if we want to coparent succesfully this is not the way to handle things.She told me to pick up my son.She apparently went partying the last couple of days and we didnt hear from her.I paid this months rent already but starting next month she will be broke.So, would i be the asshole if I stop my support completely?",WIBTA if I stop my financial support to my ex?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10v2gv2/wibta_if_i_stop_my_financial_support_to_my_ex/
10uib2d,71,"TL;DR I travel with my mother yearly and it’s out tradition. My uncle tagged along last time and it wasn’t good company. This year she invited him again without telling me and I’m thinking on not going. Probably will enjoy my vacation doing something else. AITA for that?To give a little bit of context, since I'm 18, me and my mom make a vacation trip, that happens every year and it's sort of our little tradition.I left her house when I was 22, but we stayed in touch and kept a very good relantionship. We still travel every year and it became even more special now, because we don't get to stay together as much as we used to, so we use this time to be together.2 years ago, two of my father's aunts asked where we were going on vacations that year and they would tag along, because out trips look like fun. We are caught by surprise, but my mother gives them the whole intinerary, they end up tagging with us the whole trip and being a nuisance, asking me to carry things around, they don't speak english and don't even try, so they order me around so I get stuff done for them. It was the worst experience, but eventually ended and we joked that would never have other people come along...Last year, my uncle (her brother) asked if he could travel with us on our next vacation, because it looked fun (yeah, you know where this is going).This time it was worse, we get individuals rooms, but this time, I had to share the room with my uncle so he could save some money. I live alone, so I'm not used to share a house with someone, even worse a room.Same communications issues and some personality ones, they end up fighting from time to time (siblings, you know right), by the end of the trip I told my mother that it's okay if she wants to travel with whoever she wants, but I'm not up to it and would pass next time.This year we are planning a cruise trip and some time in Europe. On thurday she told she had paid her part on the travel agency and I could send them the money to cover my part. When I talk to them, they ask if I'm Anon or Anon's Uncle.My mother had invite my uncle to travel with us again, after knowing that, I said that something came up and would call another day to finish the payment.Today I called my mother and told her that I'm not paying and won't travel this year, because I don't want to repeat the same experiencie from last year. She started crying, saying he invited himself again, and she couldn't say no, but this time would be different, because in the cruise each one can do whatever they want.Am I the asshole for not wanting to waste my vacation (the only time of the year I'm off work and can enjoy doing things that I like or just relax) traveling with someone I dislike and I feel even worse because she didn't even told me, I found out because the agency guy asked me who I were.","AITA for bailing on a trip with my mother, because she called my uncle to come along without telling me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uib2d/aita_for_bailing_on_a_trip_with_my_mother_because/

10uzaip,19,"Backstory: I (23f) have always been thin and bony, to the point where my mother took me to the doctor as a child but he told her it was normal. I did become concerningly underweight in the past few years- many people I love died, battling a chronic illness as well as depression, and a few vices (nicotine, mainly) that aided in suppressing my appetite. This past year I really got a grip on my health and started turning things around and gaining weight healthily, rebuilt my relationship with food and everything.We have very close family friends who moved out of state years ago, but we see each other 1-2 times a year- my sister &amp; I usually travel to their state in the summer for a week. I visited them last August, and they came to visit this past September after the passing of a mutual friend. In August the mother, let’s call her Kelly, badgered me several times during the trip about how thin I was. I told her I had been struggling but that I finally was turning things around and had been gaining weight. She insisted I was still too thin.In September, my mother told me that when they were staying with us Kelly kept asking her if I was bulimic, because they all saw me eat but I was too thin. It freaked my mom out but I have kept her updated on how much better I’m getting and how much more I’ve been eating, quit nicotine, etc. We live together and are close. But when my mom told Kelly I would have come to her if I had an ED, Kelly insisted “your kids never tell you what’s really going on.”Long story short, it was just way too many comments about my body and personal things when I kept insisting I’m aware of how I look and I’m really okay. Whenever we post or send pictures there’s a chance she will text me about my weight. Now it’s the time of year again when Kelly is bugging us to come visit her, but I genuinely don’t feel like spending a week in this woman’s house. When we don’t visit they take it personally because her daughters were close with us growing up, but they’re also old enough to come visit us now. AITA for not wanting to see this woman who was basically a second mother to me growing up? My mom says it’s out of concern and love, but it doesn’t really feel like it.

10ul5g5,100,"Context: I (21F) am engaged to “Isaac” (29m). Isaac has a daughter “Elaine”(3 F). Her mother “savanna”(22F) has a second daughter with bd 2 (32M).

(I wasn’t the one who called the police. I tried to be civil with her and she accused me of things and tried to get Elaine to hate me.) (Elaine LOVES me) Savanna has even refused to meet me since the day I started dating this man.Isaac and Savanna had a thing that savanna wanted that no one could touch Elaine’s hair because Isaac isn’t black. He had also not been informed she was going to mediation so everything she said went. Elaine has very curly hair like me. Savanna doesn’t actually know how to do hair as she doesn’t have any due to the same things she’s done to Elaine’s hair. They went to mediation again and the judge told her off and said we are allowed to do and wash her hair because I am black and white just like Elaine and it’s racist of her to not allow us to even wash her hair bc we “aren’t black” (judges words not mine bc savanna kept fighting saying we weren’t black)savanna always had her “sister” do Elaine’s hair in “protective” styles including extensions on a 3 yr. Old. CONSTANTLY to where Elaine is losing her hair. The mediation ALSO said we would no longer pay her child support since savanna owed Isaac a lot of money. So till that was paid off we didn’t owe her a dime. In that time, she couldn’t afford to get Elaine’s hair done anymore. Well, I started doing her hair because savanna wouldn’t even untangle her hair (Elaine hates it being done so bad. She said her moms hurts her with it then gets mad.) and Elaine has loved it! I use products for her hair specifically and her hair has grown back amazingly!  Her mom would send her back to us in the same style I had done it in the week or 2 before. Didn’t wash her hair or take it out once so I redid it one last time. Here’s the issue, savanna messaged for a week and a half straight about Elaine’s hair being done this time. Saying I don’t know anything about black people hair and calling me racist names. Threatening me and so much more. Claiming the stuff she “uses” on Elaine’s hair is better and it isn’t. She broke communication clauses. So she finally got child support again and immediately went and got her hair done by her sister in very tight braids with extensions. While continuing to harass me for doing Elaine’s hair even though I have been for months. This time, her hair was in a nice design and beautifully curly. AITA for this? And should I just back off?

Our mutual friend that my boyfriend lives with (22f) Emily was home when I called my boyfriend on my break at work, he was slurring his speech and kept passing out in the middle of speaking with me I had to shout down the phone to try to wake him back up, I told him I would call the doctor and ask Emily to take him to his appointment, he agreed that would be best and we ended the call. I spoke to the doctor and they said they didn’t want to alarm me but I needed to call an ambulance for him right away. I immediately tried to call my boyfriend back but was not answering so I called Emily and explained what had happened and told her I’d be calling an ambulance to her home.

I called him and he said he's a few blocks away and asked if I had eaten anything. I said no and that I could go grab something to eat while I waited for him. He agreed and asked to meet up again in 20 minutes. It sounded like he was in a busy place, like a store or restaurant. But he didn't give me a reason as to why he wasn't home.So I went to a nearby drive-thru and sat in the parking lot and ate and talked to friends on the phone. I tried to give him more than enough time to come back, so I actually didn't drive back to his house until 40 minutes later. Still, nobody was home. I'm getting frustrated at this point and I get the urge to leave. I'm messaging a friend and they suggest I give him one more call and to threaten to leave so that I can at least give him the opportunity to explain himself or come back.

10uyods,48,"I'm (21f) currently in a relationship with David (24m) as of 3 months. We have been acquaintances for a while now. Here's the thing, David is my older sister Ellie's (24f) ex-boyfriend from highschool. They broke up after my sister moved to college and David only took online college. We've gotten closer over the past few months since David started working at a grocery store I regularly go to. Then we began dating. We didn't think Ellie would mind because they broke up 5 years ago and David only saw it as a shallow highschool relationship. I was against telling her until some months went by. Suddenly it was a week before she decided to visit (she lives a few states away) so I thought it was a good time to tell her.I sent her a text saying I'm dating David now and I was hoping she didn't mind since it has been so long. She didn't reply but she left me on read. Then the day before she arrived she told me it was fine and hope I'm happy with David. Ok, cool. Our parents were iffy with us dating overall and I didn't know how Ellie was going to meet him after not seeing him in so long.She arrived. David wasn't there, but our parents greeted her, hugged, caught up on life. She treated me like normal and asked how my relationship with David was going, I explained how we fell in love and all that jazz. Ellie became... strange. She started making comments about how David is probably only dating me to get to her and how David is doing the same things to me that he did with her. I told her to stop and if she's being bitter say it to my face, but she kind of laughed it off and said she finds it strange that I'm dating her ex at all. I don't know why, but I saw red. I told her to just go rot in hell if she's so jealous that I'm with David now. It was a huge argument and I couldn't take it. I already hate dealing with my parents saying the same shit.AITA?

10v25e9,68,"What I thought was a reasonable comment has turned into some major family drama, and I've been instructed to ""apologize"", and I don't feel I should. Since my nephew was born, my BIL and SIL have always referred to him sarcastically as ""the kid"" when he's asking them for something.  For example, if he's asking for something at the store, SIL will call BIL and say ""the kid is asking for 'x', should I get it for him?"". They do it when they seem to think he's acting entitled or spoilt. I always bite my tongue, but in my opinion it's dehumanizing and derogatory and how you talk about an annoying stray cat, not a child. Today we were all at grandma's house and my daughter got a popsicle from the freezer. In my household, we dont have to ask for permission to get sustenance. However BIL and SIL have old school ideas about the ""right"" time to eat something. So when nephew saw daughter with a popsicle, he went and asked his mom for one. SIL looked at him, didn't even acknowledged what he'd asked, and shouted to BIL in another room, ""BIL, you think the kid should have a popsicle?"" and winked at me. I don't know why I decided today that enough was enough but I snapped back ""don't wink at me like it's some joke, and [nephew's name] is your son, not a goat. Stop calling him 'the kid'"". You would think I'd said I was announcing WW3 tomorrow. SIL immediately snapped back something along the lines of if I had an issue I shouldn't say that in front of our children, and then left the room and did not talk to to me the rest of the visit. Later my husband received a text message from MIL saying I need to apologize for ""criticizing and insulting SIL in front of nephew"". Husband says I should just apologize. I don't think I have anything to apologize for. She's so upset because she knows I'm right, she's just being pigheaded. I honestly don't regret it even a little and wish I'd called out the behavior before my nephew was old enough to remember being referred to like that. But at least when he's older he will know an adult in his life stood up for him. It's causing more drama then I honestly think it deserves. Husband says he agrees about the ""nickname"" but I should apologize anyway.

10urqde,28,"I am planning to go to a national park with my boyfriend of three years for my birthday in a couple of months. We decided to tell his parents because we all live together (including my boyfriends brother and his brothers girlfriend). His parents said they wanted to come and I had no problem with that because they’re so sweet, and despite being in America for 30 years they literally haven’t even been out of their area. So I just think it’ll be nice for them to see more of it. Well the problem arises when his parents say that they’ll let his brother and his brothers girlfriend know so they can ask for the days off. The girlfriends birthday is a day after mine so they thought it would be fun to make it a double celebration. I wouldn’t mind, but I just don’t like the girlfriend AT ALL. She also doesn’t like me.We’ve also been on trips with them before where his brother and the girlfriend have literally dictated the whole entire thing. My boyfriend and I would suggest something and they’d tell us no it’s not on the list. They also always pick seafood restaurants even though they know I have a bad reaction to seafood. It ends up coming out both ends and I end up sick and with stomach problems for a couple of days. They think it is okay since they always make sure the place has a hamburger or chicken fingers on the menu for me which I think is so annoying.Anyway, I reluctantly agreed though I told them that since I planned this we will all have an equal say on what we are doing. Of course, that did not happen. The girlfriend ended up booking an Airbnb without even asking if we liked it and it was super expensive and even all of us splitting it’s $600 EACH couple. She has made a list on where we should go and when I tell her what I want she says that no one is going to want to do this. I think she thinks she can control it all because she’s older than me. (I’m going to turn 21 and she’s turning 36).Anyway, I decided that it is my birthday too and I am going to celebrate it how I want to. I plan on telling them that my boyfriend and I are going to book our own airbnb and we are going to drive up ourselves and do the activities we want to do. (They can still be fully refunded for the airbnb). I plan on telling his parents that they are welcome to join our activities, though I understand if they don’t want to cause conflict and decide not to.I am scared I might be TA because I might make it hard for his parents and I think his brother and brothers girlfriend are going to be very upset.

10utqei,18,"I, (13F) have been avoiding, or attempting to avoid my family, especially my older brother (15M) who has autism because I just cannot handle the amount of stress it puts on me.When I was younger I was always the stereotypical ""perfect child"" who's gotten all A's and never needed help (Still am). While my brother has always struggled in one way or the other. My father has always prioritized his work and my mother was busy helping my brother because of his learning problems.Because of my brother's autism my parents get stressed out because his problems add to their own and they often argue with each other, my brother, or me. My parents usually end up taking their anger out on me, but they often realize it and apologize. But it still takes a huge mental toll on me and the fact that most of the times I interact with my parents end up like this makes me not want to interact with them at all.Even though my parents argue with me sometimes they argue way more with each other or my brother and it hurts me so much when it happens. I hate to rely on others for comfort, so most of the time I end up crying in my room while my family screams at each other. Because of this, I fear being involved with my family incase they will argue.My brother is my main cause of my stress and it makes me feel horrible saying it. My brother lacks any form of empathy and expects others to change everything that he doesn't like. On the other side my brother will go as far to make fun of me when I'm upset. He will also blame his actions on things that I have done when I was around *seven* to make his actions seem justified*.* I try so hard to spend time with him but it always goes wrong because it is always him, him and him. If we play a game, he will throw the board and scream if he even begins to lose. Every time I try to love him and spend time with him goes wrong so I have given up. I try to set boundaries but they are always broken by my family.Because of all the constant stress and worrying I have developed depression and possibly anxiety. My parents have noticed and started to bring me to therapy half a year ago. I am trying to slowly spend more time with my family but I constantly worry about something going wrong. I also tend to bottle all of my emotions up and then explode in a angry fit and I feel horrible when it happens because it makes me feel just like my family. I hate making others sad because of how it effects me.I love my family and I understand my parents difficulty with my brother ( They have gone to multiple therapists/specialists and try to accommodate with his autism. ) But I simply cannot handle all of this plus the stress from school.

10ux0zi,111,"My wife and I went to a popular restaurant in our city yesterday. It was very crowded and there was no parking. My wife was driving and she told me to go put our name in to the hostess while she drove around looking for parking. I did that and then came out to see if she could park. She still hadn’t and a few cars were circling around waiting for spots to open.  I saw a car getting ready to leave a primo spot and the only car between this spot and my wife was a car with a handicap tag on the mirror who had just pulled into the parking lot. I assumed they were going to use one of the open handicap spots, so I excitedly signaled to my wife and she was ready. However, the other vehicle passed three open handicap spots and parked in the regular spot. I was standing right in front of the car and I quickly said to the older lady driver, “I see you have a disabled tag. Would you mind taking one of the reserved spots?”  And she said that if there’s a close non-reserved spot, she prefers to use that and leave the disabled spots open in case someone else needs it. So, I said, “Ok well in this case there’s a shortage of *regular* spots and several open disabled spots that no one else can use but you.”  She grumpily said, “Now you know how we feel. Anyway, I’m parked now, aren’t I?” Then she went in to the restaurant. I ended up getting back in the car and we parked at a supermarket like two blocks away and walked to the restaurant.

10u6sml,945,"My husband  (M32) and I (F26) have been married for over 2 years now. We moved in together one week before we got married. Before getting married, I always felt disgusted when I would visit him because his house always had dog hair everywhere. Whenever I left, I would find dog hair on my clothes, in my shoes etc... and that really annoyed me. So when we moved in together, I made it clear to my husband that I wouldn't want a dirty house, and I refuse to clean after his dog. At the time, he agreed he would clean the floors and be the one to clean after the dog. A year ago, we had our first baby boy. I am very protective over my son. As a mother, I want to make sure he is safe and has a clean home where he can play freely. Previously, when the dog has encountered babies or kids, he is always very anxious, nervous, and protective of my husband. With our baby, his behaviour is worse. Now that our baby is walking and running around the house, the dog can not find a safe space and is anxious the entire time baby is awake and walking. This past month, the dog has growled at baby when baby was walking towards him and on a different occasion the dog went in to bite baby when the baby caught him off guard and got close enough to touch him. Not to mention how jealous the dog gets anytime my husband is playing with baby. My husband was there for both of these incidents and denies them as being anything serious or of concern... I felt the opposite. This past year has been the hardest year of my life as a first time mom. Not only do I not find a moment in the day to have a moment for myself, I definitely do not want to spend any free time I have cleaning after the dog, my husband, or baby. There is dog hair everywhere, the floors are always dirty with dirt, mud, dog drool, dog hair...etc. the carpet has a layer of dog hair on it. I find dog hair in all my clothes, my food, my cups, in my butt crack. I am so disgusted and annoyed at this point and it takes too much of my mental and physical energy to keep up. I am so unhappy. For the past few months I've just given up. My husband has noticed and he's picking up after me. He's been cleaning the house (but not the floors) and cooking occasionally. He's doing the best he can because he sees I'm frustrated... but still it's not enough. I am really grateful for my husband and tell him that everyday. But I want the dog out of here. Am I the Asshole?EDIT: I clean our home regularly. Our home is not a dump. Currently, any free time I have away from baby is to cook or clean. The dog was not there before me. My husband's brother abandoned the dog because the dog was jealous of his partner and causing issues in their relationship. The dog is now doing that with baby and has been doing that in our marriage. For example, the dog wants to steal the attention whenever my husband and I hug, kiss or hold hands... and my husband does end up giving the dog attention instead of me.

We hadn’t planned much, but we were invited to the casino by his friends who are a couple we like to hang out with. I turned 23 during the pandemic and I’ve never been to a casino so I didn’t know what to expect! Before we were about to leave and pick up the couple, they let us know that the fem partner is sick and won’t be able to come. I was really bummed because I was looking forward to having another girl around and playing blackjack with her. I was hesitant to continue with our plans, but I thought might as well see how it is. When we get there, I was incredibly uncomfortable from the start. Every person in there was over 50 and smelled of cigars, I wanted to leave as soon as I saw the inside. There were no slot machines, just a large room for poker and blackjack. I mentioned to Kev before we decided on these plans that I didn’t even have money to gamble and didn’t know how to play either of those games. Again, I’ve never been to a casino and had no idea what it would be like, Kev has been before and in my opinion, should have known. We played blackjack and he taught me how to play for about 20 minutes. Then they headed over to play poker and told me I shouldn’t play because I’ll lose everything. I went to the bar to order myself a drink. This is where things took a low drop. As I order my drink, a man comes up to me and says “are u my escort I ordered” and showed me his phone messages as if we were looking for each other. I said in a disappointed tone “no.” From there, another man comes up and says “can I buy you a drink, I can get a hotel room for us right upstairs. How much”. The 15 minutes I spent alone felt like an hour. I refused multiple drink orders from one man who was saying “I won big and I’m ready to blow it all on u tonight.”  I wish I were making this up. My boyfriend comes over to see me in tears, asking him if we could leave. I was wearing a t-shirt and baggy pants but every man there made me so uncomfortable. I felt pretty dismissed when I told him what happened. I was crying to him and he said: “why didn’t you say anything back.” Instead of leaving, Kev had me sit and watch him play poker. After an hour of fighting back tears, I fought my own body’s instincts, got up, and left with my car we all drove in. I texted him “happy anniversary, get an Uber because I left” and called my friend crying home. I honestly was so uncomfortable that I was scared of simply my walk alone to the car.

10v2ieh,13,"So every Monday for about 30 years me and a group of friends have met on a Monday evening to play TTRPG's like Dungeons and Dragons, etc. About a year ago we lost one of our own and it hit us pretty hard. Only a few months later another of us (Call him Dave, don't want to use real name's for reasons) lost their father, who used to look after his kids so he could come out to play. This meant either we moved the games to Dave's place or he couldn't come anymore. So of course we all offered to come to his.This has caused a couple of issues, firstly it's quite hard for us all to get there so we're often late or some people simply can't make it that week. On top of this we feel like Dave isn't really making an effort to make us comfortable. e.g: A lot of us smoke the devil's lettuce, which he wants us to do outside, which in itself is fine although in winter it wasn't so much fun and he never cleans the dog crap out of his garden so you never know what you're going to stand in. However, the real issue is that he has his son sit in on the games, which in itself is quite uncomfortable. So we are passing that stuff and rolling smokes right in front of him. None of us really want to censor ourselves on the one night a week some of us get to cut loose and destress. We obviously want Dave to be able to join us but we really don't want to be a sh\*tty influence on his kids and feel like we should say something.

She has children. One (26f) the other (23f). 26f got out of jail and pregnant. 23f is currently pregnant. Both live at home, but work.My father started calling less when I became a young adult. I would try to call or text. Everything was always screened by her. She wouldn’t relay my messages to him or he didn’t care to get back to me. They shared a cellphone for a long time. They have two cellphones now, but one uses his email and the other uses the phone number. One phone gets all my messages, the other doesn’t. I can’t pick where my messages go either to simply just talk to him.My husband and my father got really close when I joined the army and left for training (2016). But soon after, she stopped relaying all my husband’s messages to my father. They stopped hanging out, and my husband lost what little familial support he had with me being gone.At one point they (before she was his wife) had a huge falling out, they split for a good while. My father seemed happier without her. I was actually able to talk to him. Then, they were back together and married in less than 6 months right before.

And I thought I was crazy so I was like maybe she’s just shy, but then when I saw her again, she did the same thing. A bunch of small stuff started happening at first, we were in a text chat with friends planning a trip and I was asking about the booking info, and she ignored me and responded to other people then booked the place without even asking or letting me check it out. I at this point began to feel like she didn’t like me. My gut was telling me something was off. The literal next day I find out that she sent a text to my bf, groveling for his forgiveness because apparently she talked shit about me in front of him (he didn’t hear, he was on the phone with his brother and I guess she said something nasty about me in the background), but nonetheless she made it a point to make it known that she talked shit about me in front of my own spouse. She makes a ton of excuses about how much she’s dealing with to my bf. I wait for an apology and don’t get one, so the next day I texted her, laying out clear boundaries to never ever disrespect me to my spouse. She sent something saying “it wasn’t personal” and it felt super non genuine, so I told her to leave me alone and keep my name out of her mouth unless she wants to step up and take accountability. No response. I get home and chat to my bf about it, I showed him the messages and he said it looked familiar, it turned out her “apology” was copy and pasted from a convo from 5 hours earlier. The audacity. The brother tries to do damage control saying she wants to apologize in person, and she never does. The entire friend group wants me to drop it and get over it, because she “means well”. It only makes my spite grow. I blocked her on everything and found some super weird and targeted tweets she liked that made super negative implications about Mexicans and I’m Mexican… idk I just feel like maybe she doesn’t like me bc of that or bc our bf’s look extremely similar. Either way I hate her now and don’t want her ruining my wedding (especially don’t want her around my family) (she also had a convo with someone when I was present about how she plans to wear red to the next wedding she goes to and personally if she pulled that shit on me I’d lose it.

10us93w,53,"My wife (25F) and I (30M) got evicted recently. I've been behind on rent for 4 months. I do food delivery since being laid off 6 months ago. She had to quit her job because the stress was taking a toll on her anxiety at the same time.I decided to move back in with my parents because my mom has been taking care of our son (11mo) since he was 4mo and that my wife said she misses our son. We tried taking care of him ourselves but it was clear that the stress was too much on my wife. Before we moved in I expressly told her that I want her to take care of our son and herself and also to lessen the burden on my mom.The first thing she did after moving in was to sign up for job interviews. Her excuse is so we could move out ASAP so she could have her privacy. When she's not going to job interviews, she'd sleep in until well into the afternoon, find food to eat, play with our son for a bit, and go back into our room till dinnertime and repeat. Obviously this didn't go well with my parents. They pulled me aside, telling me that as her husband I can't keep enabling this behaviour.My mom wanted to talk to me personally. I've always told her everything was fine whenever she asked, contrary to what my wife was telling her, that I'm not taking my job seriously by playing hooky, playing games instead of taking jobs, fuelling her anxiety etc. I finally told her what was going on from my POV.My wife is stubborn as a rock. She'd rather writhe in pain then take her medicine if she has a fever. She refuses to take her antidepressants when she knows she'll wake up multiple times from nightmares. She refuses to eat properly even though she's has gastroparesis from her anxiety. Her not being able to take care of herself meant I had to take frequent unpaid leaves which led to my firing. She blames me for not taking enough delivery jobs when I can't get through 3 deliveries without her complaining about her stomachaches and asking me to come home. The only reason she hates me playing games is because it wasn't time spent giving her attention or working to earn money. I also know the real reason she wanted to move out is because she doesn't want to interact with my family and she blames them for ""gatekeeping our son from her."" She's also quick to pull the divorce card whenever we argue because ""I didn't even want to get married in the first place.""My mom was livid. I think she took particular offense because she offered to help take care of our son because my wife wanted to work and is now being blamed for it. I confronted my wife and she pulled the divorce card, as expected. I told her sure but I'm taking full custody. She sobs and went back to her parents' place but asks for our son. My parents and I are in agreement that she's not fit to take care of him and she should first take care of herself before even thinking about our son. I feel guilty for keeping her from our son but she had plenty of time to take care of him but chose not to.AITA?",AITA for keeping my wife away from our son?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10us93w/aita_for_keeping_my_wife_away_from_our_son/

10uuh19,46,"Throwaway to preserve the privacy of all the people involved. Also apologies in advance for any grammar mistakes, English is not my first language.I am enrolled in a master program in physics at a European University. Our class is small, so we all know each other and often get together to study. We also have a few lab courses that require us to form small groups and work together on data analysis or lab reports.Anyways, there’s this Korean classmate of mine, Y. He is a great guy (or so I thought prior to all this), but he has one major issue: he stinks. Badly. He has a strong garlic odor about him and I can’t for the life of me be around him for more than a few minutes at a time. Imagine the stench after eating 5-10 cloves of garlic every single day, that’s what he does. That’s what I’m dealing with here. Now, I absolutely hate garlic, smelling it makes me nauseous. I realize my reaction to it is very strong, which is part of the reason why I may be an asshole, but in my defense I have pretty typical ADHD-related hypersensitivity, and I just can’t cope. Our other classmates have also noticed the strong smell and have all started avoiding Y as a result. Nobody wants to be partnered up with him in the lab and be forced to work in close proximity with him for hours.Two days ago I ran into Y. He asked me if we could talk. Long story short he mentioned that he was feeling a bit down because he had noticed that nobody ever asked him to work with them in the lab and he was starting to think that we were avoiding him on purpose. He asked me if I knew anything about it and added that, since he considers me as a friend, he values my opinion a lot. Seeing him like that I felt extremely guilty and broken-hearted for him, so in that moment I thought it’d be best to tell him the truth. I explained to him what the issue was in the kindest, least judgmental and  most considerate way I could think of. I really tried my best not to offend him. Unfortunately he didn’t take it well. He got very upset very quickly, basically accusing me of insulting his culture and being racist. He told me that garlic is an essential ingredient in Korean cuisine and that just because we (Europeans?) eat bland food it doesn’t mean that he has to adapt. Essentially blew up at me and said we were all assholes before storming off. I was shocked by his reaction, mostly because I was genuinely trying to help him and because my words came from a place of compassion.Still in disbelief, I told two of my other classmates/friends what had happened and they also ripped me a new one. According to them I shouldn’t have said anything, and they’re annoyed at me for making things awkward for everyone. I do see their points, but a part of me still thinks that being honest was the right thing to do.

10v0khp,26,"I F25 have a brother M32.. that got in a disagreement regarding my parents farm. For context my parents have a farm that is about 607 Acres that has 50,cows 30 sheep,  10 pigs, 6 horses, 6 lamas , 2 donkeys and a fuck ton of chickens, ducks and turkeys. This is a rough estimate because these animals animals are either breeding or you know sold to butcher…but my point is it’s functioning farm and my parents have made profit for decades from it until about Covid hit.. it really hit my parents hard and they had to lay off a lot of workers that were helping the farm so it’s been a rough road. Fast forward to last night, my brother and I got in a drunken argument regarding the farm.. it’s my personal belief that I think my parents should sell some of the property and auction off some of the livestock so they can have a proper retirement..because well my dad is getting up there and has a lot of health issues and my brother thinks he’s running the farm well when in reality he’s not it’s in the most terrible condition I ever seen it in and I told this to him all last night… so he gets mad at me and said “ well you don’t even try to help mom and dad, you get all this money from your ex husband and can’t even chip in” ( which I do chip in money) and  then he goes on and calls my kids “spoiled brats” because I won’t let them help out on the farm. (For the readers who don’t know my children ages are F8, F6, F6, F4 and M2) I’m just really stuck on what he expects my children to do..like does really expect my 8 year old to get in a tractor and start bailing hay? And as far as my kids tending the the animals I don’t trust my brothers supervision because one time he let my 6 year old…get in a pin with the donkeys and one of them bit her, the donkeys aren’t used to being around kids. especially my wild kids. So I 100% fault him in that and not the donkey.   But back to the argument, I then just let him have it and told him if he would get his lazy fat ass up and put the Jameson down maybe, Just maybe the farm would not be facing a financial crisis. But now my family is now pissed with me because, I hurt his feeling by insinuating that he’s a fat drunk and that I don’t see him trying with the farm and that I should be more compassionate ... But I just don’t feel like apologizing to him and I don’t think I’m asshole..because most of the things I said was really factual. My brother bit off way more then he can chew with this farm and I’m really scared if god forbid something happens to my dad, my family will be in extreme debt. So idk I know this story is a lot and all over the place but please let me know if I’m the asshole here.Edit: to make a couple things straight I live 30 minutes away from my parents and we do not live on the farm and my kids go to school full time..also my brother asked for my opinion on where I stand with the farm and he was getting ready to request to borrow some money from me. Also I was helping my parents with the farm up until I had a falling out with my mom..but I don’t plan on stopping the monthly payments because I know how much my dad appreciates it and how much he loves that damn farm. And I’m planning apologizing to my brother for calling him fat ass, um I only said it to him because he called my kids spoiled brats for no reason. but everything else idk I’m still stuck on feeling I’m not the asshole",AITA for calling my older brother a lazy fat ass?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10v0khp/aita_for_calling_my_older_brother_a_lazy_fat_ass/

She said a lack of self-awareness and emotional maturity is not something she can overlook when dating someone. So I guess I’m single now.Me (23M) and my girlfriend (21F) have been together for four months now. She’s great. Beautiful, crazy intelligent, and has the best personality. Genuinely my dream girl. Except for one issue—her camera roll. For background, she dated a guy for four years in high school and the first half of college. She broke up with him last year, and has dated other people since then, leading up to me. She never really talks about him, unless telling a past story about her friend group (which he was a part of until he suddenly up and left). According to her, the reason they broke up is she realized they were on two different levels of maturity (when I mean she’s intelligent I mean she’s well known around campus and every professor adores her, and we go to a Big 12 university). She also got life threateningly sick and, while he was worried for her, she knew he wouldn’t be responsible enough to take care of her in the future (progressive heart disease). They ended on good terms, but don’t talk anymore because he is kind of an introverted guy according to her.The part I get upset about is every time she opens her camera roll to show me a past picture she scrolls past photos or videos of him and her. I’ve brought this up to her before, and she always laughs and says it’s because she’s too lazy to go through 30k photos (she hasn’t deleted pictures since 2015). These photos and videos of him and her aren’t romantic, they’re high school shenanigans and usually involve her other friends, but I still can’t help but feel jealous.Today she showed me a photo of her friends in 2018, telling me a funny story. He’s in the photo. I said “you have a lot of pictures with him” in an annoyed tone, and she said “well yeah, he grew up with me and my friends. We were kids together. It’s like a look back into my childhood.” I told her I didn’t like those pictures, and she offered to remove them and put them on a drive. I told her that wasn’t enough. She told me they were precious memories she shared with her friends and she wasn’t going to delete them just because he was in a couple.

For some extra context after traveling through the development you simply have to cross one major road, 4 lanes of traffic with a turning lane, and it’s right there in total a 5 minute drive. On the way back I was behind a car that believed I was too close to while they were effectively slamming on the breaks to pull into their driveway, almost as if they forgot where their house was, which prompted them to yell out of their window at me. Which got under my skin a little and I yelled back. Interestingly enough their house follows a sharp 120* right turn and a stop sign situated at the same turn. After the person in the car yelled at me and I promptly made my presence known all the same they pulled into their driveway. Here I pass them and they decided that it would be a good idea to follow me home. Noticing that they were following me I had called my step dad for advice.

On arrival my step dad tells me to get out of the car that I stalled anyway in a fit of rage. The following car pulls up along side me blocking the road entirely and we begin to have an all out screaming match. Where I, not so calmly, express that you cannot just follow people to their homes because you feel as if you have the right to know who they are and that they upset you. You saw my face while pulling into your driveway, and at any point could have obtained my license plate at any point. I know that you have no expectation of privacy in public areas; however, following someone home doesn’t sit right with me. Their attitude came off almost as if they were entitled to breach my safety and that even if that made me upset I was further antagonized with a “boo-hoo”. We continued screaming, unfortunately. I wanted to call the police but since my step dad had calmed me down and took a picture of the plate we played a bit of the waiting game to see if they would come back around. They did not.

His rate of business has actually accelerated in recent months and he has been giving me advice on my business as well.His step cousin was judging a business competition last weekend and I was volunteering for the organization that puts it together, so after the event we got to talking. I broke down and decided to tell him that my husband has been laid off and so we were in a dire financial situation that meant I might have to close my shop. I asked him for advice.He told me he wouldn't tell anybody and gave me advice regarding marketing and insisted on giving me the money to cover rent and a marketing budget/ other bills.I was grateful for his help and used some of the money he gave me to pay down a few credit cards and my husband ended up looking in my desk and finding out he wrote me a check. He was furious and called his step cousin, and his step cousin asked why he didn't just tell him that he was in trouble- because he could have floated him a job. My husband and I got into a big fight as a result two days ago and he said I basically announced his job loss to somebody he thought was pretentious and overbearing. He accused me of humiliating him and claims that his step cousin told his mother, and that she is a gossip. I maintain that I had no ill intent and was just trying to be realistic and ask for help. Now my husband has told his step cousin off and tells me I need to get a job. AITA?

I’m 37M and my wife is 35.My wife asked me that if there was ever a situation in which her and our two kids who are 5 and 7 were in danger who would I save first. I told her right from the bat it was a stupid question to ask and I didn’t want to keep talking about but she kept pushing and pushing for an answer so I just said out of instinct I’d save the kids first.She then got really irritated asking ‘well what about me?’ I reiterated how stupid her question was and that there is literally no point in talking about it but again she wouldn’t shut up about it. Ultimately I just said to her out of annoyance that in any scenario I’d save the kids first then go back for her and that I hoped she’d do the same considering the kids come first always.Well, now she’s pissed off at me over some fake scenario all because I said I’d save the kids over her. She says I’m an AH for being ‘unfeeling’ and ‘callous’ and that I am belittling her for calling the question stupid and she has gone on the defensive basically saying I’m calling her stupid.She has been snappy, not really talking to me and is in general just being argumentative.

10u788e,195,"My mom's boyfriend has been around since I was 12. I was a messy kid. I mainly contained myself in my room, because I felt anytime I left I always did something wrong. Accidentally leaving a wrapper on the kitchen counter. Taking a shower and not drying the wet floor. I just couldn't do anything right. My room was messy, because I felt I couldn't leave it, and I was ashamed of my existence. For all his grievances, he would never confront me. He would just yell from whichever room he found traces of my existence in, in a volume I could hear behind my closed door. I'm 22 now and I visit my mom on the weekends, as I have two (half) brothers ages 3-6 that I care about a lot. In regards to my mom's boyfriend, I don't like to acknowledge him--he will say hi, and I usually deflect by saying hi to my brothers instead. I came home around 8pm, and--in addition to the usual cast of mom, mom's boyfriend, brothers--my aunt was there. For the most part, my mom's boyfriend stayed in the living room, while my aunt, mother, and I hung out in the kitchen, only really interrupted when my brothers wanted our attention. It was a nice night. Eventually, my mom's boyfriend puts the kids to bed, and so us three decided to drink some alcohol. We're a few drinks in when he decides to join us in the kitchen. At this point, the alcohol is hitting me; my recollection is a bit foggy here, the combination of alcohol and rage. My aunt was talking about something related to politics. My mom's boyfriend, with a smirk I saw as condescending, says ""Oh, don't believe everything you read."" Me and my aunt inquire, what do you mean?Mostly, I remember he said that ""I don't believe Columbine and Sandy Hook happened."" I flipped out. I said something along the lines of, ""How can you say that when you have two children? I hope this doesn't come back to bite you in the ass. Or her!"" Pointing to my mom, who was silent. Then I either call him an outright idiot, or say that what he's saying is idiotic. In return, he mocks me. Does these ranting and and raving liberal motions with his hand, while making baby whines to imitate how he thinks I sound. And then he says, ""You know what, I just won't talk anymore."" And I say, ""Good! I am tired of hearing your mouth. My life would be better if you never spoke to me again."" I walk towards him, tell him to get out of my way, as he's blocking the doorway. He says something like, sure, I'll get out of your way. I go to my room, grab my bookbag, shoot a text to my partner asking to pick me up.Before I walk out the door, I stop to put on my shoes. My mom tries to stop me, tells me that I don't have to leave. I tell her, No. You did this. I think I even point at her for drama before I leave. That's kind of where I'm at right now.

Yes, you read that right. My mother, who is nagging me about not shaving, does not shower regularly. She also *doesn't wash her fucking hands after using the bathroom*.

10v4yiu,9,"My (24F) birthday is in a few weeks and I have decided to go away for that weekend. Among the friends that I invited are 'Sarah'(22F) and her new fiance 'John'(25M).A bit of backstory is that I have known and been on and off friends with John for about 15 years and I met and became really good friends with Sarah after they had started dating about 2 years ago but not through John.They recently got engaged and found out shortly after that they were expecting then the worst happened and she unfortunately miscarried. To be clear this is not why I want to uninvite them. Their relationship is toxic, to say the least, and has only gotten worse since the miscarriage. They will go from being madly in love to screaming the nastiest things they can think of at each other in literally the blink of an eye (I have been present for this multiple times) and then go back to normal just as fast, it is like emotional whiplash for the people around them and we never know how to behave or react once they are madly in love again. They even had a fight the night of their engagement party and went home separately. Most recently we were having a night out at the bar Sarah and I work at (John used to work there) and all of a sudden they were angry at each other again. John then went to the bar and casually said to the bartender (another good friend also invited to my birthday) that he is glad she had a miscarriage and then went without telling anyone.Sarah stayed with us for a while and eventually she went home too, then at 2 am, I got a message saying that he pushed her down the stairs. I didn't see the message then but when I messaged her the next day she said she overreacted and shouldn't have been standing so close to the stairs and just acted like everything was normal.Now things like this happen every time they go out and I know it will happen that weekend, I just want to have a relaxing weekend of drinks and fun with friends not worrying about when they will fight and having to rush off and comfort Sarah when the fight inevitably breaks out. So WIBTA?Before you crucify me for not talking to her about the relationship, both of them are very difficult volatile people and they see nothing wrong with their relationship and there is no way to get them to see the harm they are doing to each other.

A background to our relationship is my sister and I are extremely close. We grew up poor so we’ve always shared a room and bed growing up. We know everything about each other. Another important thing about our relationship is my sister is also my biggest bully. Because we’re extremely close my sister uses all my insecurities to make fun of me and make me cry whenever she gets angry at me. She would make fun of me in front of her friends and embarrass me. I was raised to respect and look out for my sister so I was always so forgiving whenever she did bully me.  Recently I’ve learned to stand up for myself.

She mentioned it in passing to me and I didn’t think much of it.Fast forward to Wednesday when I wake up and my wife is a little panicky and asking if we can buy a taser locally. I ask what going on and she tells me she has been communicating with that old friend and that he got bizarre on her - telling her they were meant to be together and that her deceased sister is talking to him. Sounds pretty weird, so I ask if I can read his messages.“No! I deleted them because they were silly.”Ok, not was I was expecting. We go to the store and get her some pepper spray and she even buys a bottle for home. Later that night, she tells me that she got him to go away by telling him that she was pregnant. He said he would give her space - again weird. Now I am reliving the day and rushing to get protection from weirdos and wondering why she would be so satisfied when she was scared earlier. She had told me his name earlier, but I have memory issues from some brain damage and I forgot. I asked for it again so at least I had it in case something happened. She refused. She tells me that she doesn’t want me to embarrass him any more than he already is. I swear I won’t even contact him but feel like it would be safer to know in case something did happen. She refuses. We go back and forth but she won’t do it.So here we are a few days later and she still refuses to tell me. She’s mad at me for saying I was having trust issues over this and that it felt like she was hiding something. We’ve been married for eight years. I know if I were in her shoes, I would be telling everyone I know about what is happening. I don’t think she’s told anyone but me. Am I being paranoid?Edit: Thank you everyone for your responses. It is a weird situation and I am not sure what I should do. The comments from women that have been stalked is incredibly compelling to me. It actually helps explain a lot. I do want to add a couple of notes to clarify some things. I should have given more clarity to the wackiness of the messages she told me she received. Aside from believing they were destined to be together, he told my wife that her dead sister (she died at five days old) was also talking to him and telling him it was meant to be.

My temper was impacted so it is much shorter than it use to be. Basically it made me much more grumpy. I have thrown things (never at people) but maybe once or twice a year. I wouldn’t be violent at all with this guy unless he was in front of us directly threatening my family. I have no desire to hunt him down and talk to him at all.  The aneurysm also put me on disability before my 50s and slashed our income to a quarter of what it once was. Needless to say, it has added a ton of stress to our lives. We have two adult children and five at home. The pregnancy excuse wasn’t odd to me for that reason. She wants to get pregnant again.

Both times she got pregnant he told her that if she didn't abort he would leave her. He has stepped up and has taken responsibilities though, but whenever things go south he accused her of making his life miserable and that he didn't want any of it. That's for background.I've been able to save some money and when I saw house's prices going down where they lived and a flat that had a very good price and was perfect for a family of four, I told her I would give her all my savings so adding her own savings she could have enough money to ask for a mortgage.I had just one condition. The house has to be in her name. I wanted to help provide stability to my niece and nephew so if they (my sister and bf) break up, there would be no doubts about the house ownership since she would be the one who would keep the kids. I have had very bad experiences with shared mortgage from friends and familiars with a lot of problems and hate in the process, so I didn't want any of it for my sister nor her kids. How I see things, everything's going to be for the kids at the end so we'll be providing for them.Here comes the tricky part. Even if the month mortgage is less than what they're paying for rent at the moment she won't be able to pay all of it (plus the shared costs of living and two kids) with her salary, so he would have to pay something to her for living there.Here is when things went very wrong.He said if he had to pay for part of the house he had to get part of the house and what we were asking from him was unfair and I was being an as***le because it meant I didn't trust their relationship.I said he was ok to pay a total stranger for the rent but not her girlfriend and that it wasn't me the one who have to have faith in them but themselves. If he really thought they were good together, he shouldn't be worried about having a house because he would be living with his family (and saving money for himself).My sister is kinda sad  because they are now fighting and some of her friends agree with her bf's opinion.I feel like an a***ole for putting her in this predicament even if my intentions were good.I'm not rich, I have a family too with two small kids, so those savings were very important to me too.I think I'm the AH for stepping in on how they do things, but not for my request.

My dad was pissed off that he couldn’t stay at his own apartment and spend time with his only daughter. He was forced to book a hotel, because 4 people simply don’t fit. Anyway, I noticed that my friend was not looking for anywhere else to stay, and when I ask for updates he keeps saying that he hasn’t heard anything. I am baffled as to why he isn’t actively fighting to get his phone back! And it makes no sense to me shouldn’t the school need a warrant?! Plus my brother is supposed to be visiting next week. And I am not making my brother pay for a hotel and I am NOT sharing a single bathroom with 2 dudes. My boyfriend isn’t happy about my male friend taking over my couch. My dad is pissed off. I have anxiety and I didn’t know what to do! So I told him to find a place within 6 days because I cannot house him another week! He doesn’t help with cleaning or grocery shopping.

There is only 3 bedrooms, so they turned their “loft” area into a bedroom. It’s not ideal, but it worked for my sister. The only problem is that the laundry room is in my sisters area. My sister doesn’t mind people coming in to do their laundry obviously, though she asks that she be home (because she’s previously had her medication go missing, which she has reasonable suspicion was her roommate who misuses his own meds, which happen to be the same). But they go in at night when she’s sleeping sometimes, and this makes my sister really uncomfortable. She’s been trying to set boundaries, and it’s getting really frustrating for her because her roommates keep going in at night. I told her that if it happens again she should be really firm with it, and actually have a sit down discussion with all of them. I believe that she’s in the right here since they all agreed from the beginning that this was her private space. Also i would be creeped out if someone walked through my room at night.

Recently, I bought a new car, a convertible. A convertible was always my dream car, dating back to even when I was a kid. Anyways, when I go to pick up my son, she sees my new car, and I thought everything was fine, until I woke up in the morning to a huge amount of texts. She says that she will not have her son riding in a convertible when he is only 9 years old. She says that he is too young, but I disagree. While I do not think he is capable of a lot of adult things at 9, I think he can handle riding in a convertible. Anyways, she demands I buy a new car, WITH a roof. Instead, I offered to get a convertible top (mine didn't come with one), and she declined saying it was too unstable. I can't afford multiple cars, so I have to choose. Eventually I decided not to get a new car, because I trust my son, and that he won't fall out of the car. A couple weeks pass, and it is time to pick up my son again. My ex meets me on the porch and says she will not let me drive off with her son in ""that deathtrap"". I won't take legal action, but after a few minutes of arguing I mentioned that this was against our custody agreement and she got really mad.

I, too, can hear them clear as day. My friend has called the local police multiple times, and each time the cops were dismayed that our leasing office hasn't done anything about it, even though friend and I have sent them multiple sound recordings and videos of them aggressively partying. It even says in the lease that quiet hours exist from 10pm-8am on weekdays and 12-8am on weekends, for Christ's sake!Each time we'd go to the leasing office our property manager would tell us to just mind our own business, as part of living in an apartment means dealing with noise. We found out later that one of the partiers actually \*works\* in the leasing office, and her friends are always hanging out with the office staff (insert eyeroll).

My neighbors are also late 30s, M/F, with kids the same ages.My back property line borders houses in a neighborhood that is accessible if you hop in the car, drive down the highway and make a turn into the next neighborhood. Or, you can just walk through my property to get to the other neighborhood. (Mine is the only ungated property that backs up to this neighborhood.) My property is about an acre. It's rectangular with the short side facing the street, so walking from the street to the back of my property is a bit of a hike. The back half also has lots of trees. I enjoy the privacy of my own little undisturbed woods.These neighbors have friends in the next neighborhood. They have been cutting through my property to get there. They never asked if it was permissible, and they even spray painted some of my trees without asking to mark the path for them and their friends so they don't get lost. They then told other neighbors (in my neighborhood, not the adjacent one) about this awesome shortcut, so I've started getting texts from other people asking to cut through. (""They"" refers to both the kids and parents. The youngest kid, 5 y/o, told me the father is the one who spray painted my trees, but I don't know how reliable this intel is. The 5 y/o is very sweet, btw.)I don't have a good reason to ask them to stop. I simply don't like it. They pass up playing with my kids but are fine to use my property to see their friends. It feels yucky, and I'm sad that my kids are passed over so often, so that may be playing into my feelings here.If they had asked me if they could cut through my property, I would have begrudgingly said yes.

It was a confusing few months after. My dad left the house a month later and stayed with my brother for a little while before leaving entirely. There was a lot of fights and crying and confusion for the next year. My father slowly started withdrawing from my brothers and I. And every time I tried talking to him he'd ignore it. I even sent a 13 page long letter that he claimed never reached him. Finally, after their divorce finalized, he sent an invitation to his wedding to my two oldest brothers and blocked me on facebook in the same week.It has been 7 years since I talked to him (last time being the day before I turned 21) and he never tried to reach out until now. In October he sent a text that basically said ""I got your number from your brother"" and my Grandmother wanted all of her grandchildren at her birthday this year and I needed to go. There was no mention of the 7 years of silence, nothing to indicate that he even acknowledged the amount of time that had passed. I thought about just ignoring it but after thinking about it I sent him a text that said breaking his silence this way was a shitty thing to do and then said he could F\* off.When I didn't get an answer for a while, I figured he wouldn't care. But then I received a message from his new wife calling me an a\*\*hole and waxing poetic about how amazing my father is and if I had wanted to talk to him I could have contacted him at any time. Very soon after, he sent a similar message with a screenshot of my text attached and telling me I was being a child.I blocked the woman's number without a response and then explained in small words that telling someone to come to a birthday party is not the best way to end a 7 year silence as well as a reminder that I had been the last person to contact him before he decided I wasn't worth the effort. I also told him to tell his wife that she should not contact me again (though the sarcasm might have been strong as I reminded him he taught me not to talk to strangers). He sent a very long message that basically called me an a-hole and immature and told me if I was going to therapy I would know that I should be a better person or something. He chastised me for not wanting to talk to his wife and then reminded me how he didn't want negativity in his life and I shouldn't be so rude and reactive. I sent him one last voice message where I told him everything I'd been wishing I could have said 7 years ago but despite cutting him off once and for all but I can't get the words out of my head.I'm not sure if this even makes sense but if I wrote everything that happened I'd be here for a year.

10uqerq,24,"4 months ago my (27F) Uncle (52M) was sadly diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. The doctors gave him 9-12 months but he unfortunately passed away 4 weeks ago. 6 months ago my partner (27M) and I booked our dream trip of a lifetime to Japan. We went and on day 2 of the trip uncle passed. My Dad (55M) was extremely close to uncle and demanded I fly back immediately. I did my best to console him from afar via phone but did not fly back due to cost and that we really wanted to have the holiday. They scheduled the funeral for the day after my flight home so I could attend. Our flight ended up being delayed so I arrived on the day of the funeral. I rushed to get the train to my hometown but the train also ended up being delayed and I missed the funeral. I made it to the wake but by the time I got there I had not slept for almost 30 hours and was horrifically jetlagged. I did my best to greet my family and offer condolences but I literally could not keep my eyes open and felt like I was going to fall over or pass out. After about 45 minutes I quietly asked my mum for her car keys and slipped out to take a nap in her car. My dad found me and went ballistic. Extended fam have also been hounding me calling me disrespectful. For context, I was always civil and kind to my uncle but we were not at all close, he was quite the bully to me growing up forever commenting on my weight and appearance (dispite being a healthy weight).

10trw4e,845,"To set the scene here, I am a 55 year old father of four and grandfather of five. The pertinent ones here are my eldest daughter Michelle who is 34, her husband Peter who is 35 &amp; my grandchildren Beth and Sam, who are 12 and 14 respectively. To give some context to the rest of this post, Beth and Sam are adopted and are black, where the rest of the family is white. The problem arose when Michelle and Peter finally saved up enough money to take their dream honeymoon which they couldn't afford when they got married. It was a month-long holiday, during which time Beth and Sam came to stay with me. Beth has beautiful curly hair and lots of it, which she obviously washes and maintains herself, but she's still learning how to do certain styles in it. I asked out of curiosity what kind of style she'd like to know and she showed me some pictures of ladies online with very impressive braids. Now, I've been bald as an egg since I was 40 and the only ""style"" I had before that was a mohawk in my 20s, so elaborate braids are a bit beyond my skillset, but a coworker of mine who is my ""work daughter"" often has her hair done in styles very similar to the ones Beth showed me. I asked her where she gets her hair done and explained it was for my granddaughter, and she told me that it's actually her sister who is a professional braider and put me in touch with her. Took Beth to the sister, she got some very cool braids which have beads on and a cute little heart pattern at the sides and the sister explained all of the upkeep stuff to us and even gave us the friends and family discount which was very nice. Well cut to Michelle's return and she's deeply unhappy about me doing this. Apparently, she has always told Beth no to getting such braiding done because she believes that she's too young for it and also because she says it's expensive and doesn't want Beth to get the idea that it's going to be an all the time thing. I've said that I'm quite happy to pay for her to get it done as often as she likes because of how happy it made her, but Michelle is still taking the huff with me about. Peter is siding with her as he says parents should be consulted about such things. Sam is sticking up for me by saying that it's nice that I'm letting Beth partake in parts of black culture she might miss out on in a white family, which wasn't even really an aspect I'd considered, honestly.

10tzkvs,334,"My partner is Michael and my stepson is Grant (10yrs)Tonight we had lasagna and salad for dinner. Grant has a portion of lasagna that was as small as his fist,  which is the usual metric we use for his portion sizes to make sure we aren't giving him more than he can handle. He took a few bites of salad and literally 2 bites of lasagna, and then said he was full.Like every kid, we struggle with getting Grant to finish his plate, so over time we've tried a lot of different strategies to get him to eat, or to figure out why he doesn't want to. He's 10, not 2, so he's at an age where he is capable of articulating his feelings, wants, and needs. Sometimes if he doesn't like a food, he will say he is full because he doesn't want to eat the rest. So we asked him if he was really full, or if he didn't like the lasagna. Grant said he was full. We asked if he would like something else, like pizza rolls or a PB&amp;J. Again, he said he was full.He has a tendency to say he is full, then ask for junk food 20 minutes later. So when we took his unfinished plate away, we reminded him that since he didn't finish dinner, he doesn't get to have dessert or junk snacks, but if he is hungry later, we are happy to make him the food options we listed earlier, or have a healthier snack like a granola bar or veggies and dip. And if he finished a healthy snack, then we will consider some dessert type stuff. We don't want to deny him food if he is hungry, but also don't want him to load up on sugar closer to bedtime. We made sure he made eye contact and understood what we were telling him.It gets to be around 8:30pm and Michael and Grant are in the living room playing Xbox together, so I slip away to have a couple bites of ice cream by myself in the kitchen. Well Grant got up and came into the kitchen to grab a snack from his snack station (it has granola bars, little bags of chips, fruit snacks, etc.), and he saw me. Immediately asked if he could have some ice cream and when I reminded him of what we discussed earlier, he burst into tears. Now Michael is saying that I was inconsiderate of Grant's feelings by ""waving the ice cream in his face"" and that I should have taken it into our bedroom so he wouldn't have seen it at all.If I was the AH in this, it would be because I ate dessert when Grant wasn't allowed to have any. But I wasn't blatant about it, and I am an adult who deserves to eat what I want in my house.

10v3bwh,28,"I saw someone else post about measurements and I thought this would be a good place to post my own query. I (25F) am taking an costuming and sewing class for a university elective. It’s not in my major, but I want to do well and learn the skill so I can make my own clothes and be crafty.We all have a sew a dress or tunic for ourselves as our current assignment so everyone paired up to help measure. As my project partner is looping the measuring tape around me and making notations, our professor is going on a bit of a rant about how a size 0 isn’t a “real” woman’s body size and being in that measurement range is sick and expecting women to be that size is toxic. Although I agree with the last bit about not expecting everyone to fit the same mold, she was being a bit mean about it imho. My project partner looks up at me from her notes with a look of pity/worry because guess what - those are my measurements. Admittedly, I’ve struggled a bit with an eating disorder years in the past (which I’ve mostly healed in therapy) but now my main issue is nausea due to a chronic illness that makes it hard to eat. I got really self conscious because a lot of the other students were joining in on the professors talk. I do feel sick and weak due to aforementioned reasons, but I didn’t really want it pointed out in front of the class. Here’s the part where I wonder if I was the asshole - I asked my project partner not to turn in my measurement notes. I asked the professor after class if we could just make the dress without going over the notes and got a “hurrmph” noise in response and she told me the answer was likely no and told me to come to office hours. I have work during her office hours so instead I sent her an email saying I didn’t feel comfortable sharing and would rather just work on the project alone with my partner. I also told her I would be missing class the next day due to being sick, which is sort of true since I always feel sick, but was mostly because I was too nervous. She wrote back saying I have a sense of entitlement asking for an exception with no reason and that without a doctors note she wouldn’t believe I was sick - she said she suspected I just didn’t like her and didn’t have respect for the class since it’s not my major and I’m probably goofing off and not taking it seriously. It’s true I come off very standoffish, blunt, and awkward due to having Asperger’s and also she’s right - I don’t like her. I have a hard time masking it even though I’ve never intentionally been rude or disrespectful. I also know my lack of participation could affect my partner. And I did lie about being too sick to come to class.

All bridesmaids and groomsmen were holding hands.

Why did they play him with a single woman? 2) why on earth did they tell the bridesmaid and groomsmen to hold hands while entering the church? I’m so angry with this situation.

She has done quite a few irritating things since he passed but this takes the cake for me. Another important note is her and my dad didn't have a great relationship but this was not due to abuse or cheating. They just weren't happy and stayed married for religious reasons. Well fast forward to about 2 weeks ago... the 16th of January, a couple days before the anniversary of my dads death, my mom calls my sister (20f) and I (24f) and says that she is talking to someone. Even though this wasn't the greatest timing, we accepted that she was ready to move on. She then asked us if we could meet him which we thought was way too soon so we said ""No we'd like to wait but we are happy for you"" and she said okay and that she respected this. Well about 4 days later, on January 20th, she tells us that they're dating officially. Great. Still happy for her. Then... last week.. She calls up and says that they're engaged and keep in mind we have not met this guy nor did he ever reach out to us. Yes, she asked us to meet him but we didn't feel we were ready for that yet because we're at a different stage in mourning then my mom and WE DIDNT KNOW THEY WOULD GET ENGAGED after about 10 days of dating. Their wedding is already planned for June.. Now, I'm opposed to the whole thing and don't trust the guy whatsoever.

They were famous, successful and at the height of their popularity and had won so many awards when she decided to leave the band because she got tired of the lifestyle and fame. A few days ago my soon-to-be SIL rang me up to tell me not to bring my fiancée with me to her wedding. Her reason was the wedding would be her special day and my fiancée would just take all the attention from SIL since fiancée is famous. I told SIL I understood, but if my fiancée were to be excluded, then I didn't think I should come either. I mean my sisters and other cousins would attend the wedding with their SO/bf/gf, it's so unfair to exclude my fiancée just because she may get recognized.She got upset and accused me of prioritizing a stranger over family. I told her my fiancée is no stranger. We have a serious relationship and are about to get married soon. When I told fiancée this, she looked really heartbroken because she really loves my family and likewise, but said she understood where SIL's coming from.

10ug3m8,53,"So I (23F), am autistic. I currently work as a stripper at a club, and have done so for about 10 months so far. Before you ask, no, working elsewhere or in a different job is not an option ATM.Due to my ASD, I struggle to find and keep good friends, although I've been trying my best, I've only recently made some, one, I'll call her Donna, who has recently taken on a big sister type role towards me and after I've opened up to her about my ASD, she's been very supportive and looking out for me. Also, not many at work know about my ASD. Jane is one of Donnas friends, Ive always wanted to get to know her, but she's very hot and cold with me. One day she'll chat to me, the next she ignores me. I'm not sure why, or if it's something I'm doing, but after talking to Donna about it, she has said she'll help me look out for if there's anything I'm doing that may cause issues so I can be more mindful in the future. I am trying myself, however, I don't always see or understand if I am doing something, and need an outside view to help.All that being said, for the most part, I can mask very well, given those I have told had no idea I was on the spectrum until I told them, even those with experience with ASD, so it's unlikely those I havn't told would know, including Jane.To the issue, the other day Jane and I were chatting during a quiet period and I was talking with her about pole dancing (a common interest). I asked her for some tips on a certain trick since I know she can do it, and I still don't quite have it fully downpat yet. She started saying how she's sick of me always having to be the best, since ""whenever I'm on stage I'm always trying to show off with lots of tricks and prove that I'm so amazing"".I don't talk about pole very often as I get the impression I've upset some other girls because I have learnt a lot quicker than average, as most people take many months or years to get to where I'm at, and I've done it in significantly less time (all safely of course). I'm very lucky I'm naturally good at it, and am very fixated on it, which leads me to practice / train ~15 hrs a week. Which is how I've managed to get where I am so fast.I also know Jane has done pole for a few years now. I never meant or thought I came across as a showoff or anything, but it's clearly causing issues.During this, donna came up and asked what was going on. I was silent in shock and Donna ended up having a go at Jane saying she ""shouldn't take out her jealousy on me, I work hard for what I've got and have earned it"".I'm now getting messages from Jane saying things about how I've manipulated Donna against her and that Donna is her best friend, so to back off, and so on.

Oliver, unlike me, went to get his master's and started working years after I did.Oliver always made sure to tell my what a mistake I made by not getting an Msc degree. I will always be lower paid than him, no company will give me higher roles, I will get stuck at the bottom of the ladder, etc. He stopped for a little bit after finishing his studies, but recently, he started again stronger than ever.

10uzjoh,16,"Hubs (m 44) &amp; I (F48) have been on a very strong trivia team along with a regular group of  about 8 people, for almost a year. The team was started by a 55 year old-ish hetero-cis couple a few years ago. They were very welcoming when we started coming to the weekly Thursday night event, they became fast friends of ours. The team members are varied in education,  talents &amp; professions, we consistently win 1st place. Honestly it's the best night of my week, we've only missed two nights this whole time, oftentimes the founding members are not there.  Last May, after a few months of killing it, I started saying we should get team shirts, even drawing designs as we played each week. But lots of things piled onto life &amp; we (as a team) never got very far in the planning process of the shirts, mostly because the founders were gone a lot, Hubs &amp; I were moving into a new house, etc. etc.  After the Holidays I pulled up a website &amp; started to put a design together, sharing screenshots with the whole team in our group text.  The female of the founding couple immediately started criticizing every aspect of the design, color, style. This woman  is a talker, she honestly can't stop talking, its like she has so little in life to talk about, she can’t stand to not have attention, so she just fills the air with blithering about nothing.  Since she was the only one responding to the texts about my shirt design idea, I texted her directly, &amp; she continued to complain &amp; criticize, so I  dropped it &amp; moved on with life, prepping for the  upcoming work week.  I'm a midwife &amp; work has been really busy lately &amp; my off time is very limited.  For professional comparison she recently got a job in a daycare, after not having worked for the last 30+ years of raising 3 kids, her work/life balance is radically different from mine. She continued to blow  up my phone with long multiple texts in a row, like 5 here, 11 there, in a row without me responding. I was blown away by how much she kept pestering me with drawn out, passive aggressive, controlling and manipulative messages,  ignoring my boundaries &amp; requests to drop it. I stopped responding to her. That following work week was ROUGH, rough AF! She texted me during a birth that was super complicated, with a shoulder dystocia &amp; a resuscitation. I really needed to decompress and regather my thoughts professionally, she kept texting, I kept ignoring her. I replied somewhat annoyed and again said I’d rather talk in person about it, if at all. This last Thursday, she texted again, saying she was now mad at me for not responding &amp; ultimately kicked my hubs &amp; I off the team via text as we were walking in to play, saying that I was too hostile.

And some things that Sarah says/does triggers that fear response and I shut down. Ex. when she tells me that I’m not allowed any more plants in my room b/c she prefers a more “minimalist aesthetic”. I could understand this if I was decorating the whole apartment but I was confining the 4 or 5 I had to my room.)Or if I had a friend over to hang out in my room and chat without permission (I always tell her when I have a guest but I don’t always “ask permission”) she got upset with me and told me I crossed her boundaries because she doesn’t want people over b/c she’s tired from work/has anxiety. Even though we were just talking quietly in my room- she didn’t have to socialize or engage at all.There’s more, but it’s all similar.I am not mad at Sarah, I know she has her own struggles and I try to be aware of that. But what I have noticed is every time she tells me what to do I shut down. I got rid of all but one of my plants to make her happy, I stopped inviting people over. Etc.But, all of this has me feeling out of control.My therapist suggested that I (firstly) bring up how I’m feeling and address it directly. I failed. Every time I brought it up she’d turn it around and talk about how crowded spaces give her anxiety regardless of if it’s “her” space. Or reiterate that me bringing anyone other than my 2 pre approved friends without permission and weeks of planning triggers her social anxiety. And every time I would shut down and back off.So my therapist suggested that I consider getting a place of my own. Since I make more than I used to I could afford a 1br by myself now. And that it would be beneficial for my healing if I had a space that was 100% mine and I was in total control of, that I wouldn't feel like I had to sacrifice my needs/wants to “keep the peace”.I told Sarah that I was considering getting my own place when our lease is up. Her responses? “If we don’t live together we won’t even be friends anymore because you’ll forget all about me”. “I’ll have to move back into my parents.” To that I offered to help her find a place because at her wage she could at least afford a studio apartment but she responded that she “doesn’t want to live alone because she might ‘hurt’ herself”. She also pointed out that it’s not her fault that I’m a people pleaser so I shouldn’t punish her for it.Since then, things are rough. I get off work first so I make our lunches for the next day then prep dinner so it’s ready when she gets home. Since our talk she has refused to eat any of the food I’ve cooked, makes comments about having to find a new roommate/place that feel very targeted.

Long story short: dad drug dealer, mom drug addict, mom died and dad went to jail for life, no family to take me on, bounced in the the system from the ages of 7 to 18. Then I became homeless, worked as an escort, went to college and this is currently my second corporate job. Like you might imagine, I do not like to talk about my personal life. Even more so because of my first corporate job, where I was the last to be given time off during holidays or summer, because I was a single woman without children.When I started at my current job, I made the decision that I was not going to get to know anyone. Colleagues will stay just that, colleagues. So I arrive at my desk at 08:45, I'm out the door at 5, I take my lunch break outside the office, don't take my breaks with the other, refuse all invites to things outside work ..My new colleagues got the hint when I just said ""no thank you"" when they would invite me, when I opted out of the secret sant even though it was obvious that I celebrated, and when instead of going to a colleague's wedding, I RSVPd no, then sent a gift. They leave me alone, I leave them alone, but we are friendly and am happy to lend a hand when needed.Then this woman started with us almost 3 months ago.

After taking her aside away from others.Well, instead of backing off, she doubled her efforts. And it's not in a creepy way, or a way that would allow me to go to HR, but I do not like it.Finally fed up with her, instead of trying to redirect the conversation, or changing the subject, I just stare at her -dead in the eye- without saying anything. Yesterday she came by my desk, and asked if I had plans this weekend, I said yes I do, but didn't elaborate. Then she asked me what my plans were, and if I had someone special that I was going to spend my time with. So I just started her dead in the eye and said nothing for minutes. At first she was annoyed, then she started rambling, then she turned red and left in a hurry.Another colleague sitting close by gave me this disappointed look and told me that they understood I was a private person, but that that was no way to treat someone who was genuinely friendly, someone who was trying to include me in the social life of the office.So AITA?Edit: so this blew up, I posted it and didn't get back, thought maybe I would get max 100 replies since this is almost drama free.

Nothing worked. That's why I chose this method.Most people said this is HR worthy, so I think I will be having a casual conversation with our HR rep tomorrow.Some people said me refusing to talk can hinder my career, like I said above I am friendly and do talk with my coworkers, I just refuse to talk about anything beyond what could be considered small talk, and I don't have a personal relationship with any of them outside working hours.

When we first met I was fairly established in my career and she had was an impoverished med student completing her final year. I'm financially responsibly, maybe a little frugal, but I love splurging from time to time. My wife, especially she we first met had a habit of living well outside her means. Designer clothes, fancy restaurants and a mountain of debt. Most of the financial security we have now is due to my financial planning/investments/ savings. My wife has honestly improved her spending habits, she's not perfect, but she's come a long way. BUT she does have the habit of getting carried away. Especially when it comes to gift giving. She spends $1000s on things I don't want or need. I suspect she also does it so she feels less guilty on spending $1000s on herself. She's incredibly loving and generous and gift giving is her love language (actions are mine). A few years ago it was mildly annoying/largely endearing, but now we have a hefty mortgage,  a baby daughter, I'm working part time only and we're planning IVF for our 2nd child this year. Our finances are ok, but things are a little tight and we've cut back on a lot of little luxuries. My wife is away for work and my anniversary gift arrived today. It is a $3500 coffee machine. This absurd given our financial circumstance. Also we agreed to a $500 budget. I'm pretty annoyed as it feels disrespectful given our conversations about money recently. It makes me think of all the little luxuries I've given up to save money, and for her to so causally spend our savings is making me furious. I've had many conversations with her in the past about this exact behaviour, but she's usually so sweet and upset when I want to return something, I end up keeping things I don't want or need. I really want to return the coffee machine tomorrow to make it absolutely clear I don't want this gift.  To be clear, we have an excellent, loving and supportive marriage. Even in my annoyance I know my wife just wanted me to have the very best coffee machine and there was no malice intended. But equally she should know this is not what I want. I just don't want to have the same conversation about returning this gift and then backing down again. Would it be childish of me to return it without telling her?

Also, any time we go out somewhere (mall, grocery shopping, etc) she complains of a headache and being super tired when we get home, even if we only went out for an hour or two. She also sleeps for a good amount at night but is super sluggish and tired during the day and says she needs a nap. At first, I thought that maybe she went to bed late and that’s why she was so tired but our rooms are right next to each other and she goes to sleep way earlier than me. I have been concerned about these things for a while but I assumed the headaches and sleepiness could be just due to puberty and the physical changes a regular 13 yr old goes through.For the past week, I’ve noticed that she is always skipping dinner by saying she is full or not eating much. I wouldn’t be too concerned with this if she was eating big and nutritious lunches but she’s not. She’ll eat a huge bowl of sugary cereal in the morning and something random like ramen, sandwich, instant pasta for lunch and when it’s time for dinner she claims she’s full. I don’t believe that at all because none of that is enough for her to be full since she’s 5’8 and 180lbs and it was never enough for her before. She’s struggled with her weight for years now (chubby since she was a toddler) and it’s something that my dad is always getting into her about and is something she’s always told me hurts her. I’m concerned that she’s restricting her food intake by skipping dinner and approached her about it today.

It seems he loves receiving them but not good at giving them at all.First year, I gave him a huge gift he wanted (I had doubts about this bc my friend reminded me that it's too big too early in the rs but he kinda sulked and said that's the only thing he wants and I can gift him anything if I don't gift him this), and he gave me a $20 game. Price difference was $500 to $20, at a time when my income was half his. I kicked a fuss over it, especially bc he asked for the gift, and he ended up gifting me another while complaining that I only want expensive gifts. That remark left a bad taste in my mouth, bc how dare he say that considering what he got. What he gave me in the end was still half the cost of what I got him, and I would have been happy with it anyway had he not added his remark in.Learning from the prev experience, the next year we set a price point. Our gifts to each other was good and pretty equal. This year the relationship was getting much better and we had a great time in general.Last year he was running out of clothes bc he had a major weight gain. I gave him several clothes, $200 worth. When my birthday came I told him I wanted something that was half the price of what I got him. He said that what I wanted is too impractical, so he gifted me an ice cream cake that was so bad no one in my family wanted to eat it. I forced myself to eat half the cake and when I couldn't anymore, I had to throw away the rest. When he asked how the cake was, I told him that it wasn't good. He said sorry the cake he gave was bad.His birthday is approaching. Honestly I just think he's super bad at gift giving in general.

I normally use a chain to get any issues with my car fixed but there is not one here. My car is now inoperable and I need a new alternator (and now because of the wait probably a battery)I asked around for recommendations last Wednesday and one of my coworkers had a friend that is basically a mobile mechanic which was the most convenient since my car was dead. (He used to have a shop but a recent hurricane destroyed it.) I decided to have that guy come out and he did a diagnostic. From the start communication was not his strong suit. He eventually gave me a quote which I approved on Friday. It took him from Wednesday to Friday to get the quote to me. Then on Friday evening he messaged me that he is picking the part up Saturday morning and should be at my place by 9/10am the latest. “Unless something unexpected happens”. Well Saturday 9/10 comes and I don’t hear from him. I messaged at Noon asking if something happened. No response. I message again at 5pm because I need my car that if he can’t do it I need to go somewhere else. He responded in 10 minutes that he picked up my part and got sick and then went home. But he did NOT communicate that to me. I ask if he thinks he will feel better on Sunday and would do the work. He did not reply. I then messaged him yesterday at 11am asking for an update and at this point on Monday. I still have not received any communication. I’m the most pissed about the lack of communication. If he would have messaged me Saturday “I got the part but I’m really not feeling well sorry” or a message like that on Sunday id be a little more understanding. But now I haven’t had my car for almost a week and I’m planning to take it to a shop today which I will have to call a tow truck and still have to wait a few days.

10uwwv5,23,"I (19M) go to a college really far away from home and last semester I took a leave of absence to treat my depression. Recently, my mom (50F) has been using Life360 several times a day to find my location. Everywhere I go, my mom would text me asking me where I was going or what I was doing. And she would always try to control me by telling me what to do. I can’t just ignore her because she will call me constantly and relentlessly until I pick up. For instance, last night I wanted to go to a party. She tracked me down and wrote an essay long text against me going. But it wasn’t just college. One day, I was out with my friend for a few hours and out of nowhere she texted me calling my friend a “bitch” and for me to come home. She has never allowed me to have friends and this is the first time I have ever hanged out with someone. I am 19 years old. For an hour straight, she called me non-stop and I did not pick up because I was angry at her.  And what scares me is how she would send obsessive texts to me. Here’s an example: “I love you Don't ever leave me😩” Today, I confronted her and told her that this level of obsession with me is unhealthy. She defended herself by saying that she wanted to make sure I was doing okay because I had a severe depressive episode last semester.

I had agreed with her to go for an hour and a half then she would drive me home. When we showed up I quickly greeted anyone i was introduced to by my mom then stayed on the couch. There were about 30-40 people at this party and it quickly became overwhelming being in a small house with so many people. A few times I had to hide out on the bathroom to stop a panic attack or to cry, but I did my best to stay until the agreed time. When that time came I messaged my mom that It was time. (The car ride is 10 minutes but It crossed many main roads without side walks so she didn’t want me walking home.) She told me she would say her goodbyes then she’d drive me home and come back to continue partying with everyone. After 20 minutes passed I messaged her again asking if she was done so we could leave. She didn’t end up responding so I waited a few minutes longer before messaging her again. She again didn’t respond. I went to look for her though I was already overwhelmed with everything.

I went back to my messages and saw she read them but didn’t respond so I didn’t bother messaging her again. After sometime I was kicked out the bathroom as people had to actually use it so I was moved back onto the couch. By then I was extremely exhausted with everything both mentally and physically as I barley slept the night before due to insomnia.

I turned to her and yelled about her lying to me about when we’d leave and called her a bitch.

When they come out my dogs run up and jump up at the opening on top and just today, not even 24 hrs of being back, they yelled at my wife and I to handle our dogs. Mind you that the dogs didn't get over the wall just jump and bark. The neighbors decided to yell at my wife about the issue and it upset me.

So, am I the A-hole if I choose to just install the fence and null out the problem?Edit: The issue alone isn't that my dogs bark and are loud, it's about my dogs jumping and peeking a head over and a paw, just to fall back down all while barking.I should also mention this riles up the neighbors dog as well.",WIBTA for putting up a 5-6 ft fence,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10usap6/wibta_for_putting_up_a_56_ft_fence/

My wife has hid/lied to me about talking to her friends and my own family, literally lying about how controlling I was and other bad stuff about me that turned out to be false or exaggerated (things like her going through my phone daily then telling everyone I went through HER phone daily when I in-fact barley went through her phone) it was always a betrayal of trust because she would literally force tears and say she was not lying about talking to these people about me when I would find out about it and she then would admit to it.

We got married, have a 3 year old daughter and we're expecting again. My wife has a difficult pregnancy and she is on medical leave. My ex contacted me to inform me that we have a daughter (greta- fake name). I was surprised to say the least. I asked for a dna test. She refused at first, but i told her that without a dna test, i won't do anything. In the end we had the test and it was positive. I agreed to a coparenting plan and greta (fake name) came to my house 2 weekends a month. Idk what i expected, but it was way worse. She was rude to my wife all the time, was rude to our staff (we have a lady who cooks and a lady who cleans for us, since we both work) and on several occasions was rude to my 3yo daughter as well. My wife, as i mentioned, has a difficult pregnancy. A week ago, she had to spend the night at the hospital. I wasn't allowed to stay with her so i went home. It was  greta's weekend at my house so she came to stay there. She didn't know yet about my wife being pregnant (it doesn't show, she is only 4 months and with the right clothes you can't tell).

This wasn't the first time she hurled insults at them. I then snapped and told her to take her things, i'll take her to her mother's house. I dropped her off at her mom's place, told her what happened and how she won't be allowed back in my house unless she apologizes to my wife and my 3yo.

10u14xq,143,"This was a while ago, but my family and I still get into arguments over it to this day. When I was in high school, my mom used to send emails from my school account to various different teachers and community leaders to try to make sure I was taking every opportunity. I repeatedly told her not to do this, because it was weird, I didn't really need her help and I was already doing quite well in school- but she insisted that she was helping me, and kept doing it. I locked her out of my account twice, but both times was persuaded by her to give her my password again. She's my mom, so what can you do?Anyways, she eventually writes an email to an organization signing me up to volunteer- I would have gladly done it, but the problem was that I had a Model UN conference that day, so now I had to explain to the organizer who was expecting me to come that I had to cancel last-minute, making me look like a real jerk. I was pretty upset with my mom for putting me in this spot, but whatever. I told her off about her not even mentioning or asking me whether I was busy before signing me up, but she said that it was my fault for never telling her when my conference was. I maintained that 1) she never asked, because if she did I would have happily told her, and 2) she shouldn't have signed me up without my permission or telling me regardless.I sent an email to the organizer informing them that they had been talking to my mom in the past few emails instead of me, and that it was her that had signed me up. I didn't make her look bad- just told the facts, apologized for making them have to find a replacement so late, and said that if there were any other opportunities for volunteering, that I would be in touch. That made my mom so mad that she refused to talk to me, even without reading the email. My dad was also pretty pissed off at me, though not as much as my mom- he said that I had part of the blame to take as well, as I had let my mom have access to my email, so I was kind of asking for it to happen. Also, he said that she was my mom, and was only trying to help me before I threw her under the bus in the email by blaming her to the organizer.

Maybe I did make the wrong decision, though.Anyways, I was just wondering what you guys thought about it. Pretty much my entire family is against me here, but was what I did really that bad?

His best friend (20m), let's call him C. has also become a great friend of mine over this time.I currently work in retail on Saturdays in addition to my normal job. Last year in August a girl named A. (26f) also started working there. We found out that she lives only 2 minutes away from me, so we often drove together to work. She's very nice but not the type of person I'd immediately see as ""good friend material"". In November me and a friend, who also works at my retail job, were spending a Saturday evening at her house with my bf H., C. and two other friends. We both had a shift till 6:30 PM, A. had to work till 8:30 PM. After her shift she called to vent about something at work and my friend suggested she should come over for a little bit.So that's where C. and A. met for the first time. Sideinfo: C's. last relationship ended pretty roughly, with his ex cheating on him, so he decided to not enter a new relationship till he finished his training to be a cop. A. knew this from the start and said she was fine with this, but wouldn't miss a chance to cuddle with him or act all lovey dovey. Keep in mind that it was never him, who made a move, he's open for F+, but nothing more. A week ago she told him, that she only wanted to be friends and he was completely fine with that.She now thinks he's being contradicting with his own actions, called him childish, deleted all of their pictures and blocked him on snap, then added him back today.On Saturday we all hung out again at my place and when the two of them went outside to smoke a cigarette, she tried to kiss him, he turned his head and aperently made a face. Afterwards she was silent the whole evening.I asked C. about it and he told me that he was confused and ""she wants to be just friends, friends don't do this"". I mean he's right. Around 1AM both of them drove home.I texted her and asked how she felt. A. answered that she was fine and that she was drinking a glass of wine. This made me worried, since she's not supposed to have alcohol. She has to take medication for her heart and was in the hospital from Monday to Tuesday, because she was experiencing excruciating pain in her head. The  doctors couldn't give her an exact diagnose. On top of that she is a really small girl and doesn't weigh much.So I texted C. what happened cause both of them obviously need to talk things through. About 20 minutes later, I got a text from A. telling me to stop talking to C. about the situation, since she doesn't wanna talk to him. I told her that she needed to talk things out but I only got  a ""leave me alone, fr"", so I did. I know she's probably mad that I'm not texting her an apology or something, but I'm tired of this bs.

After I miscarried my and bfs daughter, we gave in on getting the cat on the condition she also helps with the care taking of said kitten. She agreed and was excited.

I'm still not sure who was in the wrong in this situation from an etiquette standpoint.My husband's cousin (the groom) was getting married in another state and asked if our daughter would be the flower girl. We happily agreed, assuming that if our daughter were a part of the wedding ceremony, she would be invited to the reception. It turned out that not clarifying this was a mistake. By the time we learned that it was a child-free wedding, we had already planned a family vacation around this wedding and booked plane tickets. Since we were traveling out of state and anyone we knew that could watch our kids was invited to the wedding, I had no choice but to RSVP no to the reception so that I could watch my kids (ages 3 and 11 months). I did still attend the ceremony and allow my daughter to be a flower girl. I also asked my husband to please forgo the reception and come back to his relative's house with me. The entirety of the rest of the trip was spent mainly with his immediate family. The only people that he would have only seen at the reception were his cousin's immediate family, who he did get to say hello to at the ceremony. I am told that the bride was not happy that my husband missed the reception and felt that I should have taken the kids back from the wedding on my own and let him enjoy time with his family.Prior to the wedding I did not flat out ask the bride if my children could attend the reception, but I did mention that we would be unable to attend the reception because we had no childcare. The bride offered to find a sitter. I declined this because my children are very young, would be sleeping in a strange place (and for that matter, could I invite a sitter into my in-laws home?), and have never been watched by anyone outside of family before.So, I realize there are a lot of potential asshole moves at play here. Are my husband and I assholes for assuming our children could attend a wedding reception where one is part of the ceremony? But, are the bride and groom assholes for asking our child to be part of the out of state ceremony and then excluding her from the reception without being upfront that it is child-free? I am leaning toward ESH for those (correct me if I'm wrong), BUT biggest question:Am I an asshole for asking my husband to miss the reception with me so that I was not sitting home alone at his relative's house while the babies slept?I'm adding an edit - I'm not sure if this makes a difference to the YTA voters, but another cousin got married out of state a month later and many more family members attended that wedding.

I'm also part of a group chat on Discord with friends I've made from that club where we mostly just share memes. I never really knew anyone coming into the club because before college, I've been going to high school online since before the pandemic. I had really bad social anxiety on top of being targeted by bullies for being gay at previous schools, so since I never really socialized with any of my classmates during high school, I only knew a handful of people at my college from previous schools, and most of them are straight.

Then I decided that that was enough discord for that night, and shamefully walked away from the situation, turned off my phone, and went to sleep (it was 1 AM).The next morning, nothing unusual really happened. I went to class, did some homework, ate lunch with my friends, and went home. Then I opened Instagram while laying in bed to discover a barrage of messages on Instagram from the club officer group chat trying to notify me that two of my ""friends"" from the Discord group made callout posts on their stories about what I had said.I confronted those people from the club through Instagram DMs and basically told them ""Listen, I'm sorry. I thought it was humorous, but when I posted it, I immediately realized my mistake. But I feel like maybe you're blowing it a little bit out of proportion. I don't see why you had to publicize this situation when we could just talk it out."" They responded by blocking me.People from the club seem to be pretty divided on the situation, with some writing me off as an asshole and a bully and others choosing to look past a dumb mistake that, in my opinion, wasn't that big of a deal. This situation has gotten to the point to where I stopped showing up to club meetings and am seriously considering dropping the club entirely because I don't feel like I'm stepping into a safe space when I go to that club anymore. I feel like shit for the part I played in this drama. I can see how I was the asshole for saying what I said, but this turned into something else that it shouldn't've been.

10ug3zo,37,"F (22) here. My parents have always wanted to buy a home together but have struggled financially. My Mum has not worked my whole life, out of choice. My dad has several health problems.When I got a full-time job at age 21, and before I even received my first paycheck, my parents asked me to save towards their home deposit and to get a home loan with them. They said that they needed me to go on the mortgage so that they could get a 30-year mortgage, with lower repayments. At the time I had never lived out of home and didn't fully understand what me being on their home loan meant.I had been talking about buying a house with my partner for at least a year prior to this. When my mother found out that her and my father wouldn't be eligible for a $10,000 home grant if I bought with my partner first, she asked me to hold off on buying until they bought their home (with my name on the loan). During this time I went to the bank and discovered I would not have enough borrowing power to put my name on their home and on the one with my partner. This led to my partner buying the house, and me being unable to put my name on it. Which my parents were well aware of and were fine with, as long as they got their home.Flash forward a year and I have given them nearly $30,000 AUD towards their home deposit and their other expenses, all of which they have spent. I also prioritised saving for them over saving for the home with my partner, which they were aware of. They are still looking to buy or build a house in the next year. They have also engaged with several builders to gather information about the process. On two occasions, after my partner bought our house, my parents asked me if I no longer wanted to go on their mortgage with them. Feeling pressured and uncomfortable, I said it was still fine for me to do. Recently, with guidance from my other siblings, I have realised that my parents prioritise their needs above mine and that they are not good with money. I  feel anxious about going on a loan with them, as they are not financially stable and are very dependent on me for money.

10uqf1c,27,"Little background, I(21F) live with My Sister(25F), My brother(24M), and Mother(50F) Currently only my sister and I have a Job, though currently I have less shifts than my sister.My family decided they want to move out of my childhood home as it's becoming too expensive to live there anymore, this is understandable yet during this time my Fiancé(23M) and I were talking about moving in together. I've brought this up to my family and they were all very excited for me to go live with him. I brought up saving my money for a passport and plane ticket as well as spending money as my Fiancé currently is living in another country due to work, this set my mother off as this would mean I wouldn't be giving her the normal amount for rent and bills. Currently only my sister and I have jobs and pay for everything in the house together for the last 5 years, I brought up to my sister about my move and she agreed to pay more for rent and bills so that I can save. My sister paid 50% of bills prior to this, now she pays 75% (even with the rent going up)Soon after I started to save my money, the rent went up and now my sister uses almost her full paycheck to pay rent and bills. My mother started demanding that I pay even more for rent and bills, but my sister has said it's fine that I don't. Without my extra money they are scrapping by barely now, and I understand I live with them and they need help; I have already agreed to not giving any more money due to myself trying to move. As well my brother and mother both haven't been trying to get jobs anyways, and even when my sister and I ask them to help they simply don't and expect us to keep paying everything for them. My sister said if I was able to get my passport and ticket right now she wouldn't mind if I left just to teach the others a lesson that they can't just rely on me for everything, I feel bad about it but I know since her and I are the only ones paying anything it would be up to only her once I left.I've spoken to my Fiancé about all this and he offered to pay for my passport and my ticket so that I would only need to save money for the actual trip and until I get a job in the new country, due to this technically I could give more money to my family for their rent and their current move. Yet once speaking to my sister on the situation she said that I don't need to give anymore then I already have, and she doesn't want me to give any more money. Hearing this my mother blew up screaming that I have to give my full paychecks up since everything is gonna be paid for me, and that having it sit in my bank doing nothing is simply wasting it. I don't think I'm in the wrong since my sister and I have spoken about it.But AITA for not giving them more money?  **Edit:** For those asking, I've asked my sister to come with me but she says she wishes to stay with my mother no matter what. I've tried changing her mind, but she refuses to leave. As well both my mother and brother are perfectly fine, they have no disabilities.

10v2pwq,7,"So I, (19 F) was adopted from China at age 2.5. A few days ago, my friend (19 M) and I were getting into a long conversation about the United State's current geopolitical standings (we both currently live in the US). He has expressed his dislike of US politics and his desire to immigrate from the US on multiple occasions. During our conversation, he told me he was jealous that I was adopted from a country other than the United States because I could renounce being tied to this country- and wished he could have been adopted too.I would like to say that choosing to renounce your country of origin isn't the same as being taken from it.I understand that the US is not a perfect country, but I think it's important to know that adoption doesn't necessarily wipe your slate clean. It comes with its own hardships, especially adapting to a new cultural region. I understand that at the surface, it's easy to see all of the success stories of kids being given better lives with loving families and going on to be happy.. but that doesn't happen for everyone. And on top of that, serious psychological issues can come from adoption. I can only speak from my own personal experiences, and I am super grateful to have been adopted into a family that provided me with a good life. Still, I remember growing up and having major abandonment issues that stemmed from being abandoned in an elevator at 1 month. I grew up in a family and community that had no ties to my cultural heritage, and that does create a gap that will probably take years to fill. I'm not trying to gatekeep, but there are things my friend will never have to experience, and quite frankly, as someone who has gone through it, I don't want him to. I don't want him to know what it feels like to believe that you weren't good enough for your parents to come back for you because even after all of these years, it still hurts. I know my friend doesn't mean anything malicious by his statement, but I can't help but feel like he's only taking things at face value and not realizing the negatives.",WIBTA for getting upset at a friend for telling me he wishes he was adopted?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10v2pwq/wibta_for_getting_upset_at_a_friend_for_telling/
10u6yej,115,"I (F35) am getting married this spring to my fiancé (M35) after being together for 7 years. When we started talking about marriage a few years ago, we both agreed that we wanted an intimate wedding since we are both on the introverted side. We initially wanted to do a small wedding aboard, but because of the pandemic and his mother's health, we decided against it. We found a small venue and we are paying for everything ourselves. Last November, I sent out save the dates. My (F28) cousin who is also a bridesmaid, called me letting me know that she received the invitation and that she let everyone know about the wedding. At first, I corrected her and let her know I sent her a save the date (there was no information about the venue or times, just the date and the city and state the wedding was going to be at) and I figured she was just excited since she has never been in a wedding before. She started asking me about how many people she could bring, and I let her know because of costs and the size of the venue, she was only going to be able to bring her father, sister, and her long-term boyfriend.She started freaking out that she had invited a lot of people to my wedding and now she had to tell them that they couldn't come and how that was embarrassing for her. I told her she never asked to invite people to my wedding and I didn't want people that I didn't know to be there. Two minutes after she hung up, she called me back and gave me an ultimatum- I allow her to bring her boyfriend's mother (who I haven't met before and does not live with my cousin) or she was not going to be in my wedding. I told her firmly, ""I'm sorry you feel that way but that cannot be done. I'm sorry to hear that you don't want to be in the wedding anymore but I can't budge on this."" I hung up the phone.After not speaking to her for a few months, I saw her yesterday at a family gathering, but she made it a point not to engage with me at all. I decided to text her after the gathering letting her know that I was sorry to miss her earlier but I wanted her to know the invitation was going to be sent next week.She asked again about her boyfriend's mother. I let her know again that was not possible, but depending on how many people RSVP,  I could see about the mom but I was not going to make any promises. She replied back, saying that her and her family talked and they decided that they did not want to come because I insulted her family by not allowing the boyfriend's mom to come. My sister and my mom think I should still send the invite to them,(They think that if I don't invite them they are going to cause more drama) but my fiancé does not. I'm torn and hurt because I love my cousins and want them to be there but after the ultimatum she gave me and her not listening to my reasons why her boyfriend's mom can't come as well as inviting people without consulting me, I'm leaning more towards to revoking her invitation.

10u84rm,78,"I (32M) live in Colorado, and my grandparents (86F and 89M) live in South Carolina. Their only daughter, my mother, passed away when I was 4. I was an only child as well, so they only have 1 full grandchild. My brother and sister are through another marriage so they are not technically related by blood.             Last year my grandmother had a stroke. She recovered quickly, although there is noticeable changes. She doesn't socialize anymore and she just doesn't want to do anything really other than call and talk to me (which is perfectly fine, I love talking to my nanny). My grandfather has been in the hospital a few times in the last year, all for heart issues. He refuses to take his medicine anymore and lives on mayonnaise sandwiches despite them being relatively well-off.           Yesterday my grandfather had to go to the hospital for major chest pains, but he got angry and left. Today he went back up there for the same reason, and after a few hours the head nurse gave me a call asking his ""mental baseline"", describing him as yelling shouting and running up and down the halls. The staff eventually made my grandmother leave the premises (they were fussing and she seemed to be antagonizing him). They are both declining in health rather fast; my grandmother mentally and my grandfather physically. I've tried in the past to get an in-home nurse, but my grandmother claims they are stealing from her (she's always believed home nurses do that, it's not a new issue from the stroke or age) or she doesn't like them because they are ""ethnic"" (she uses worse terms). Oddly, she really wants to go to a nursing home.          I can pay for in home nurses and caretakers for several years with my current salary and savings, but my grandmother doesn't want that. They both want me to move back to SC and live with them as their caretaker instead. I miss my childhood home, but I'm certainly not qualified as a caretaker. I'm disabled and honestly can't stand their constant bickering over petty problems (large days long fights have happened over my grandfather simply asking ""is that grandchild on the phone?"" to her responding ""oh just shut up and go outside""). I can't see myself being able to maintain my sanity and finances while caring for them full time, as they live in a very rural area and I work in IT /security. There's no industries nearby where they live that I have skills in. They both tell me I can just work in any job with a computer, and keep suggesting Walmart or McDonald's because ""there are computers there, they'll pay you the same as a XYZ security firm"". I know I'm technically the ""next in line"" for care responsibilities, but I live in a place I love, have good jobs, great insurance, and am able to save up substantial funds to buy a house in the future. I don't have any of that back in SC. I have some family and very bad memories, and that's it.

10uskuk,25,"So kind of a long story My wife and I currently live with my mother-in-law (please don’t judge, we are actively house hunting and it is not easy at all). We pay her rent and live in a garage converted studio apartment attached to the house. My wife and I both work mostly from home. I’m a mental health counselor for a private agency with very limited office space, so I can only go in one day a week. Because my wife and I are on top of each other in the studio and I really need to talk to my clients in a private space due to HIPAA (plus I would probably distract her from her work since I’m talking all day long), my mother in law told me I could work in her guest room. It’s been a really good arrangement  so far because my MIL told me she never uses the room so I’m not in her way, and I can close the door for privacy. Also I was in an extreme bind of where I would work and this solves my problem. I’ve always let her know how grateful I am for letting me use the space.My wife has an aunt who used to live here. She is the ex-wife of my MIL’s brother and they are very close. She lived here rent free while my wife had to pay rent, which I always thought was pretty fucked up, but my MIL is really good to her sister in law and usually does prioritize her over my wife, and it wasn’t my business. Anyway, my wife’s aunt contacted my MIL to say she needed somewhere to go for a few days and so my MIL told her she can have the guest room. She works during the day so I figured we won’t need the room at the same time, but my MIL basically said she wanted me to find somewhere else to work during those days (she also didn’t specify how many days). I told her that wouldn’t be possible given that my office isn’t available and I need somewhere private. Tomorrow I’m planning on just using the room while aunt is at work, and I’ll take all my stuff out before she gets back so it’s not in her way. I feel like this is fair since part of our arrangement is me using that room for work, but I guess I wonder if I’m being TA, just because usually I’m usually extremely passive and people pleasing and  let people walk all over me, and this is my first time really being assertive and standing up for what I need when it comes to my MIL (I like to try to please her).Also, there is no other space to work, there is the guest room, my MIL’s room, and the dining room and kitchen which are common spaces that I don’t want to take over.

10uwkdl,26,"I bought apple juice and didn't have a fridge myself so I kept it in Friend A's fridge who was absolutely fine with it being there for as long as I wanted. Friend B, who is friends with us both, drank it without asking or telling me after about a week and a half. (Apparently they asked friend A's if it was theirs and when they said no, they took it). The day after they did this I had actually bought a really nice meal that I wanted to drink the juice with (I'm a very broke college student so really nice doesn't really happen that often). When I found out my juice had been drunk I was livid inside but politely and calmly asked friend B to replace it. Some backstory, I'm very big on sharing but my one rule is you must ask. I HATE people taking my stuff without asking and I also don't like it when people expect me to share. I love helping my friends out and offering whatever I can even if they don't ask but I despise the notion that people are entitled to that and I firmly believe that, at the end of the day, if you want something, you should ask for it and not expect it to just be given to you. Friend B knows this and has actually called me annoying because I'm too polite and it irritates them when I ask for something, for example to bottled water or their snacks when I should just take it.Anyway, Friend B wasn't happy that I asked for them to buy me another one because they give me stuff as well and not letting them have the juice was selfish and they would never share their stuff with me again but I maintained that it wasn't them drinking the juice that was the problem, it was them taking it without asking that pissed me off (The meal I bought wasn't planned so if they had asked me the day they drank it, since I wasn't planning on drinking it I would've given it to them, no problem). They still didn't get why I was upset but said they they would replace it, however, for about a month afterwards, I didn't get the drink. I asked in total around four times and each time I did, they got visibly very annoyed which I felt was unfair. I know they went to the campus cafe a lot during that time because I'd often see them coming back with food from there with our friend group (I didn't really fit in with them and felt very unwanted and ignored whenever I hung around with them and I noticed they were hanging out a lot without me before this happened. Eventually I just stopped trying). One day I saw them all together in the cafe and asked them once again for the juice and they finally bought it but they were not happy at all.I don't really think I'm an asshole for wanting the drink but I admit that I might be and that I should've just left it. I also think I could be TA for pestering them about it after asking the first time.If any of this was unclear just let me know and I'll clarify whatever you need me to.edit bc i think ppl might come to this conclusion which is a fair assumption but not true: before this there were no similar issues, the reason i felt excluded is because i don't have many things in common with them and i always felt like an outsider (i'm black british and they're african american which i didn't think would be a big difference but i guess in this case it was). whenever i tried to talk about something i thought we could all relate to they'd ignore me and talk about something else of which i had never heard of before. at some point everytime i hung out with them i was silent in a corner while they talked and felt quite lonely so i stopped hanging out with them as much.",AITA for asking my friend to buy me a replacement apple juice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uwkdl/aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_buy_me_a_replacement/
10v2l6h,7,"Hi I'm new to Reddit so please bear with me if I do something wrong, (also this is probably something stupid and just a small problem in general but it happens to me a lot with my parents).Basically today/for the past few days I have been sick. I have mild asthma that only acts up when I get sick, and my asthma in general has gotten a lot worse since I recovered from covid.I had to go to the GP with my mum in the morning then the ER with my dad because I was struggling to breathe. At the ER I had to stay for a minimum of 3-4 hours before they let me go and my dad had work today (he works from home), therefore it resulted in taking up his time, but he didn't complain. When we had gotten back I still felt short of breath and I imagine they were quite annoyed at me because I had already visited the doctor twice, however they didn't say anything. Due to the fact that I was sick and struggling to breathe they had to fuss around with me and try to make me feel comfortable which I really appreciated. However when I got up from bed to say that I had a really bad cramp in both of my feet my dad claimed that I was being spoiled and shouldn't be complaining about such a small problem. I then asked if he was telling me that the cramps I was experiencing were irrelevant and he said yes since it was ""not related to my asthma"" and I couldn't possibly have two problems at once because frankly that's just impossible. Either way the pain got so bad that I had to sit down on the floor clutching my cramp and my dad then started to complain about me (in front of my face) with my mum saying that I was being dramatic (she agreed). In that moment I really wished that they would stop being so insensitive and I really detested them but couldn't say anything because then they would most likely drag me out of the house and lock me out for a few hours.

Once my parents found out that Chad was not coming to the wedding they got very upset with me saying I was selfish and inconsiderate for not bringing my husband to my brothers wedding. when I had tried to explain that we could only afford for me to go, and even if we could afford for Chad to go there was no timing that would work. Since due to both of our jobs it would be if we fly in Friday night stay for the Saturday wedding fly out Sunday morning. They just said I was being selfish for not willing to spend a lot of money to get to my brothers wedding even though he spent a grand to come to mine. Now anytime that I tried to talk to my parents they bring up The wedding and ask if I have looked again to see Chad could go. But every time I look ticket prices are still about $700 for one, and there is only one flight that could work but it would mean he flys all night and then arrives about 5 hours before the wedding but one ticket is $850. my parents had also somehow found out that my husband is due for a bonus sometime in March to May and are complaining that we aren’t using that money to buy the plane ticket. Even though we don’t have that money and don’t know how much we’re getting. And we are both very uncomfortable with spending money we don’t have. They said that I should just put it on my credit card and just pay it off later when I get a chance. Though I am very uncomfortable with that because I don’t want to go into debt over sending my husband who has met my brother maybe 5 times to my brothers wedding.

I have an official card that allows me to park on special spots. My daughter (1F) has Down Syndrome and has the same card. You need to be at least 80 % disabled to get the card. My SO (39M) doesn't drive, it's relevant. I recently had to move out because of moisture and mold problems, heating wasn't working and isolation was nonexistent. My daughter's room's ceiling had a big hole and it was raining inside. Landlord wouldn't do anything and my daughter caught bronchitis, which is life-threatening for her as she has a heart condition. We had the chance to find a nice flat and had to move in quickly. It was exhausting, I had to drive back and forth with my little car and take care of all paperwork (my country loves administrative papers!). My SO is just unable to fill a form... The last day my aunt (62F) and uncle (61M) came to give a hand as my uncle has a truck and a trailer. They moved furniture and appliance that wouldn't fit in my little car. I was at the new place tidying and taking care of my daughter when they arrived with all the big stuff. I had parked on the disabled spot as I was exhausted, boitering in pain and on the verge of a meltdown (had to take diazepam). I rarely park on disabled spots unless I really need it, if I'm OK I park on normal spots and let disabled spots free for someone who needs it more than I do. This day no normal spots were available near the entrance of the building. So my uncle began yelling at me that I shouldn't park on a disabled spot and required that I move my car. I asked him if I forgot to display my card on the windshield (he might not be aware that I had a card). He yelled that the neighbor (60sF) needs it more as she REALLY is disabled and I'm not. I told him I would move my car when I finish unloading it and the neighbor would be able to park. He yelled more and more YOU'RE NOT DISABLED!!! My family never accepted my disabilities, even with medical certificates and State acknowledgement. For them I'm just lazy. I'm a SAHM and got State allowance for disabled people for my daughter and myself. My SO works. I wouldn't budge as I wasn't able to drive after taking diazepam.

10v49w9,4,"My girlfriend (33F, we’ll call her Jane) just launched her career in Real Estate as a buyers agent. She is currently on her second week of being in the office. She’s still in the learning phase of her career, and it often takes anywhere from 2 - 6 months to produce your first sale.My brother (48M, we’ll call him Ricky) has been renting our childhood home from our parents for the past decade. Ricky has decided he is going to buy a house with his fiancé(50F). The decision has been made that our Childhood home is going on the market to be sold.Ricky and my parents agree that the childhood home needs renovations before it is ready to hit the market. Ricky is pretty handy and has decided to take on almost all of the remodeling himself. The 3 Bedroom 2 bathroom house is getting all new flooring, carpet, paint, vanities, as well as general facelifts to the exterior. Ricky has been calling Jane and I for the past two weeks demanding that we help him with the renovations since we are both going to “benefit from this”. Ricky has been calling Jane, telling her what kind of house they are looking for, giving her details and ideas, essentially providing her with the notion that Jane is going to be their Buyers Agent.Jane and I were a bit hesitant with his demands for help, feeling that he should hire professional help instead of doing all renovations with just him and I, but I owe him a few favors and decided I would help with the renovations. I spent about 10 hours today at the house removing old flooring and vanities, helping where I could.When I came home, Jane asked if Ricky was still interested in using her as a buyers agent, as she wanted to get started on searching for listings with Ricky. I shot Ricky  a text: “Jane is so excited to work with you! Let her know when you want to get started looking for houses!”Ricky responded: “Jane can help by selling our parents house.”Naturally this upset Jane, as she is not a listing agent and would not be able to sell the house at this time. She was really looking forward to working with Ricky to find his future home, and now she feels insulted that she is not getting his business nor his trust.Ricky is using a family friend that has been in the real estate business for over 20 years and has helped multiple family members buy property. Jane understood Ricky’s decision but this still was a blow to her ego.Insulted by the fact that he was leading Jane on and ultimately not using her as his buyers agent, I texted Ricky: “that’s unfortunate. Jane is not a listing agent, she’s a buyers agent. She won’t be able to do much in the way of selling our parents house. Good luck with the remaining renovations. We’ll see you at the next family holiday.”He has not responded yet, but I feel a sense of dread. I feel that I may have taken it too far, but I also feel like it was a dick move on his part to not use Jane as his buyers agent.

10usyr9,18,"I (24M) am the only son of my parents (55F and 56M). They divorced when I was only two months old due to him cheating on my mom. She got my custody, and he had visitation every other weekend, when I would stay at his house, where he lives with my stepmother (50F) and my half-brother (16M). When I went it would all go pretty well, no major conflicts.Here in Spain a divorced parent has to pay child support until the child is 26 or they can support themself on their own. He's started multiple legal procedures to reduce the amount he pays (something like €350 a month) or stop paying at all. Lately he's been insistent that I find a job, which I'm looking for as well as I finish my studies in web development.He's told his lawyer to say that he wants to stop paying because now his wife lost her job (she left it) and he can't  pay anymore with just one salary (I'm sure she's got right to unemployment compensation, also his salary isn't that low). I told him I was looking for a job but that I wanted to prioritise more my studies (I'm two subjects away from finishing), so he told the lawyer I'm not looking AT ALL for a job and that I only got two subjects from a ""little computing course"". It's not the first time he pulls something like that, and he always tries to pay less or not pay. He straight up would refuse to pay his half of my college tuition even if he knew my mom can't pay it all alone. Or the time he bought me a phone and put me on a good plan that he said he'd pay, just to find out he was using the money on MY ACCOUNT, that my grandma gave me, to pay for it. He's always complaining and trying to get me on his side. I'm pretty much getting tired of all this.I kept going every other weekend because I thought I could trust him and that he wouldn't try to screw me over what I tell him. He's had a lot of opportunities but he always screwed it. I'm done and I'll tell him it's over, that he always failed me and cared more about his money than about me.WIBTA if I stop going and tell him it's because of his stunts, even though they'll say they miss me and I should go more often? He will probably tell my grandma how ""it's a shame"" so she'll tell me they're so sad. The woman has a good heart but he makes her believe what he wants. I'm just tired of those stunts but I'm afraid I'll sound too harsh or something if I straight up say I can no longer trust him and that has made me not want to visit him.Lastly: sorry for any grammar or spelling issues.

But the reason it’s complicated (messed up actually) is my father has been in multiple affairs ever since I was a little kid, and my parents have gotten into fights over that for years… But she hasn’t divorced him because of poor health, and she believes I need a father figure. I’ve grown up with that my whole life. Every year, they’ll fight, my mom threatens to leave, I comfort her, my dad asks for forgiveness. And then things are okay again. I currently live away from my parents, but I text my mom often. And their fight has happened again recently, so my mom has been telling me how she’s angry and can’t wait to divorce him. My mom expects me to comfort her which I try to do of course. But this time, I wasn’t asking her as many questions about what they fought over since I already know… it’s the same usual thing.

I know it's only because she loves us and everything, and I know I should just let it go, but it gets so hard because I feel like there's no privacy. My siblings also all (mostly) think the same thing. For example, she's gone through our rooms before. I don't know if that's normal for a parent to do or not, but whenever she thinks something's up and someone's keeping secrets from her, she just searches through our rooms to try and see if we're hiding anything. Recently she stopped doing this with my oldest sister because she's practically an adult and my mom trusts her, but my other sisters, my brother and I still deal with this. My mom also has read my younger sister's journal multiple times and then got mad at her for something my sister wrote.Nobody (minus my oldest sister) really opens up to her and tells her things, because my mom tends to try and handle everyone's problems herself. I know she's looking out for her kids, but sometimes there's problems we can handle without her help, and we're all older now. One time she yelled at some kids at my school (in front of people) because they were making fun of me, and this just made a bunch of kids make fun of me more. Yesterday my brother came to me and told me that my mom had been looking through our room earlier. I was already not feeling well so I got annoyed quickly, and so I went to confront her about it.

I had to stay late on campus and my bf, just started dating, let me stay at his place for the second night in a row so I wouldn't have to make my long commute that late. He dropped me off at home in the morning and had breakfast with all of us. My dad has a few knives that he doesn't let anyone use, there's nothing sentimental about them, he just likes having a few knives of his own. That's completely fine and no one touches them, we use the many other knives we have. I was running around the kitchen and trying to get everything on the table quickly since we had a guest. There was a knife next to the already cut bread, so I assumed that's the knife they used to cut bread, and cut a few more pieces off. I truly did not notice that it was my dad's knife, it looks almost identical to the regular big knife we have, if I did, I wouldn't touch it.Fast forward to the end of the day when I'm already in bed and I hear screaming from the kitchen. Next thing I know is my dad comes into my room and asks if I used his knife, I told him that I don't think I did. He asked if I cut the bread that morning and that's when it hit me that it was his knife. I told him that I didn't notice which knife it was since I was running around and setting the table. I probably should've apologized right then and there but I didn't have the time. He started yelling at me about it, called me a moron, cursed me out, slammed the door and left. I kind of just froze and burst into tears, he very rarely raises his voice, let alone curses at any of us. He didn't speak to me this morning and hasn't said a word to me all day. I've been in my room doing schoolwork and honestly don't want to talk to him either. My mom told me that he just said it in the heat of the moment and didn't mean it, that his words don't cancel out any good things he's done. I know the don't, but it was incredibly hurtful. She suggested I apologize, I told her that I would if he didn't scream and curse at me.I heard her bring up the subject to him a few times today.

I'm still PO'd so tell me, Reddit, who's AH here?We are in our 60s and have a big extended family scattered across the US, but no kids or grandkids of our own. We don't live near any of our family so we rarely see them in person but we keep in touch other ways.A few years ago my adult nephew and his girlfriend had a kid, Ethan. We get regular updates about Ethan via text, social media, etc, sometimes multiple times a day. Ethan is a delightful child, and we immediately fell in love with the boy. Watching him grow up is a real bright spot in our days.We aren't wealthy by any means but we have a little bit of extra money now and then, so whenever we can, we send Ethan presents. A book or toy every two weeks. Something bigger on special occasions. He gets presents from other family members, too, we're not the only ones.The issue is that my SO feels if we sent presents to Ethan, we should also be sending presents to Ethan's pre-teen half-sister (my nephew's girlfriend's child by a prior relationship) so she doesn't feel left out. And, he thinks we should be sending presents to other young relatives within our extended family across the US. (Most of whom we don't know because we have lost touch with most of these folks - it is only with Ethan's father that we are somewhat close, because he is good about sending updates.)'My SO's reasoning is that we should be sensitive to how all the other children might feel. He says they might be hurt if they see what we do for one child and feel left out.I told him, all these other children have their own relatives and friends who give them things, that we know nothing about, and that's fine because it's none of our business. I wouldn't dream of imposing on them on Ethan's behalf, telling them how to spend their money on children, so why should I feel obligated the other way around.

10uszet,37,"Let me preface this by saying I love my dad. He was the main parent who supported me both in childhood and now.For some background:Three and a half months ago he went to the hospital for a surgery. It was supposed to take two weeks max until he would be able to get back home. It ended up taking almost three months. During that time, I was the only person in my household who could drive as my older brother, who lives at home, didn't pass his drivers test the first time he took it and was too nervous to retake it even though it's be at least a year and my mom is divorced from my dad and lives two hours away with my two little siblings, for which my dad gets placement every other weekend. This meant that every other weekend I had to drive home from college, 30ish minutes away, to pick up my siblings, get groceries for my brother, take my brother to work, drop off my siblings, etc. It was a lot but I made it to my winter break with minimal breakdowns.On to more recent events:My dad got back a week before Christmas and was home for almost a month when, due to some complications with his recovery, he had to go back to the hospital, this time for only two to three weeks, thank God. I wasn't at college during this time so while I had to the same things as last time, I wasn't dealing with midterms and finals. He got home again and all was well, or so I thought.Now the problem: According to his nurse who comes every mon/wed/Fri, he's doing to much around the house cleaning, driving, etc. He contacted me to ask if I could stop living in the dorms for potentially the rest of the semester to help him out at home, not dropping the semester, just being a full time commuter student, full time being minimum of 12 credits, I have 14. Helping him would consist of helping him with his wounds, doing housework, taking my brother to work, and picking up/dropping off my little siblings.After much deliberation, I decided to tell him no, helping him is much to much work on top of my school work and that the ask was just too big. He said that he didn't want to ask me and I that I was the last resort and if I had any solutions I could think of, tell him. I gave him a couple, which he seemed dissatisfied with, but held my ground. He does seem genuinely sorry that he had to ask but I'm still saying no.So I want to ask, am I the asshole?Edit:My older brother is 22, I am 19, my two little siblings are 13 and 9. I do not have a vehicle of my own and subsequently do not have an actual parking pass, meaning I have to buy a 25 dollar temporary one every week I would have the vehicle. My older brother currently lives with my dad, who has started getting groceries delivered. My brother works 3 to 4 days a week for roughly 5 hours each",AITA because I said no to helping my dad?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uszet/aita_because_i_said_no_to_helping_my_dad/

Most people use their own picture for their profile so I should as well. The issue is I'm a bit chubby, and wear glasses, which has seemed to make most people filter me out.Even when I wrote people on my own they would call me mean Japanese terms for chubster, and make fun of me for only learning Japanese because of anime (which is true but it's really not relevant at all).So I looked up some pictures of handsome guys online and then went with the picture of a male model called Jordan Barrett instead. I thought they'd assume anyway that that wasn't mine actually. However this seems not to be the case and suddenly I got a lot of messages from women, many asking if I wanted to practice together and have videocall, some complimenting me on my looks and asking if I was taken. I found this quite superficial but I did play a long with it to practice. I met one girl I seemed to get along with really well so eventually I agreed to have a videocall. When she saw me in the video she got upset with me and claimed I had been leading her on, even though I hadn't.

10uy6al,22,"Hey guys, so I'll give a little context before I begin, I was in a two-year relationship with my first-ever girlfriend. She was a year older than me 22 at the time and I'm 21. We had our ups and downs but overall I had a good time. We recently broke up and I haven't been able to let go, so here is my story.About six months ago she had asked me for a fancy ring, to which I asked why she was asking for such a present well I couldn't afford it. We had a big fight, where she said I called her materialistic(I never did) and for me to never get her anything again. I ignored that because how could I not give my girlfriend gifts?Christmas comes around and I proceed to get some of my savings and buy a ring, I'm not going to get into details but it was a lot for me, I didn't have enough left over to get my parents anything or my sister. She told me that she was struggling to her parents a present so I help her out and framed a family picture of them. I showed up on Christmas eve with my gifts, to my surprise, she told me she was sorry and that my gift hadn't arrived. I was upset but took it in, I didn't want to ruin Christmas. I had to go home so she opened her present later that night and was amazed by it, she loved it, I was so happy but kinda sad I hadn't gotten anything.The days go by and my gift arrives, I go to her house to get it, she's getting ready for dinner and tells me that it's in the closet, I go and open it, it was 4 pairs of socks (ones with designs on them, which I like but I was expecting more) my reaction wasn't the best and I went like ""you got me socks?"","" is this a joke?"". Everything went south from there, her mom came in and she told her that I didn't like my gift, I said I did like it but they're socks, and she was very angry, I tried on a pair and she stowed the rest away. We had a family dinner so I went with her but I was speechless, I kept my word about going and acted normal, there was a party afterward. On our way there I proceeded to apologize for my reaction and tried to make things right, she exploded on me, saying that I was expecting a gift of the same price as the ring, calling me ungrateful it was terrible, she said that she wanted to go home. I took her home and she told me to wait in the car she came back down and threw the ring I gave her in the car stating she didn't want it anymore. I tried to fix things but I couldn't get her to understand that I just wanted to see some effort.This ultimately ended in her distancing herself from me for like three weeks, she then texted me saying I deserved to talk to her, where I apologized again and thanked her for the times we had. She never thought she did anything wrong, I asked her for the socks as I wanted to keep them as a memory to stay humble but she returned them for her money back. She then said I was transactional and always expecting things in return, but all I wanted was reciprocity. I'm satisfied with who I was with her, but doubt that I was a bad person.",AITA for expecting more from my girlfriend's Christmas present,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uy6al/aita_for_expecting_more_from_my_girlfriends/

They call me “lazy” for not being fit even though i  try my best and exercise and I am in the basketball team.

When I told them while crying(i couldn’t help it) that I don’t want them to talk about it so often because I’m trying and said that it was mean, they were really upset and said that I am oversensitive. And said that it is important to remind me of what to improve on, which I added that they could be more constructive and not mean. I genuinely just wanted to talk to them and not offend them.

10uu0ad,8,"Please excuse me for any formatting issues. This is my very first post.  I have (26/F) and my husband (25/M) moved to our current town a few years ago together. We recently just moved into a very nice apartment with the help of a friend my husband made here (29/M) in July. In Aug that same friend (29/M) asked to crash on our couch until he left for the military, which was about a month out (mid Sept). We agreed because he’s a cool dude and helped us move. A week before his ship date I could tell he was acting differently, almost as if he was extremely stressed. He admitted to me that the idea of joining the military was daunting, and 2-3 days before his ship date he ended up backing out. This was all very understandable to us. I told him I would be scared to a degree as well and that he shouldn’t feel pressured to do anything he doesn’t feel comfortable doing. He then asked us could he stay until early December, to which we agreed.    When December came he left to go be with his family for most of the month, but then returned at the end of the month and didn’t say anything about him moving. Only that now he was looking into joining a different branch of the military. This annoyed me because 1) he seems to have forgotten that he was supposed to leave in early December and 2) he never even asked could he stay longer. If he would’ve asked I probably wouldn’t be as upset.        January rolls around and he begins to annoy me even more. We live in a 1 bd 1bth apartment, and our bathroom is in our room. He will go in the bathroom for 2 hours to “stretch” leaving us unable to use our own bathroom. We have to knock several times for him to come out. He also took our clothes out the washer and put them on top of the dryer to wash his clothes.    Now it is feb and he told my husband that the recruiter is still on leave so he has to wait. At this point I want him gone and to have full use of my apartment. He seems to no longer have any plans of leaving anytime soon ( I’m not too sure this different branch of the military thing will even pan out) and it’s been 5+ months of him sleeping on our couch FOR FREE. Even if he starts the enlistment process it’s going to take at least a month ( just like last time) for him to be shipped out. Would I be the asshole for telling him to leave by the end of the month? (Feb 28th) My issue is that his plans kept changing and now his plans are up in the air. Also that he didn’t even bothered to ask could he stay for  the end of December, for any of January, and now seems to have invited himself to stay all of Feb. We’ve allowed him to stay here for 5 months for free because we care about him. He’s been working the entire time so we know he has money for his own place.EDIT: we’ve known him for over a year. He helped us move in July of 2022 and then asked in Aug of 2022 could he crash on our couch until mid September of 2022. It is now Feb 2023 and he is still here with little to no plans of leaving any time soon.

I got the car November 2021, a 2012 Hyundai Elantra priced at 2000$ (got it from a family friend) and it was put under her name because I couldn’t get it insured until my g2.

Her justification to this was “well your term was up” but there was never a verbal or written agreement of this She drives it all the time (more then I have and like it’s her own vehicle) and expects me to continue paying insurance, and up keep that she is causing my car to need.

My 3rd trimester was rough, and it's been nearly 6 months since I've slept through the night. Dev is breastfed, so I do all the overnights with him while Jim sleeps, he typically gets 8-10 hours of sleep per night. I also take care of Dev during the day. Jim takes Dev for an hour or so when he gets home and I use that time to try and rush to catch up on chores so Jim and I don't argue.Jim is quick to point out when i don't do something, for ex: in the kitchen I'll wash dishes, clean the stove, wipe counters and table, organize pantry, sweep the floor, but I won't have the energy to mop. Instead of acknowledging all I do around the house, Jim constantly points out what i don't do: I see you can't be bothered to mop the floor. Must be nice to do nothing all day. I wish I could stay home and be lazy. You have no excuse for this! (And it goes like that across all the household chores.)I try to explain to Jim I'm constantly exhausted, I'm dealing with chronic pain issues, ehlers danlos, osteoarthritis, pots, mcas, gastroparesis, and neuropathy. Plus I've struggled on and off for years with anxiety, depression and ptsd. (I have a therapist.)

He'll ask me if I capable of taking care of Dev since I'm obviously inept at taking care of the house. Says he hopes I don't neglect Dev like I neglect my other responsibilities. That he will take Dev and leave if I don't get my act together and start doing better. And it goes on.I finally got fed up and snapped at Jim to shut up and leave me alone.

Sorry if this is long and drawn out, also for any formatting issues, on mobile.So, one of my good friends' wedding was at the end of August 22. It was a quickly planned wedding (started planning around late February/early March, as far as I know). I was asked to be a groomsmen, but then in like April or May, he advised us that we have to pay around $250 each for a tuxedo but just to rent it. I thought I was able to cover mine, but I realized over time that I wouldn't be able to as I have been basically living paycheck to paycheck, even after switching jobs in May, I have a little more wiggle room but still having to catch up on bills and whatnot, I'm still running tight on finances, on top of my fiance leaving her job for personal reasons.I told my friend in late June/early July that I'm not going to be able to afford the rental, he said he understood and said he would try to help me. I just want to add that he was fired from his job back in February, then picked up another job, granted it was lower paying, but he was laid off from that job at the start of July, so he hasn't had a full time job since then. I didn't want to burden him with trying to help me, so I just advised I would still be at the wedding, just not a groomsmen. About a week or so after that, both him and his wife-to-be messaged me, basically guilt tripping me about coming to the wedding to be a groomsmen. I got annoyed and told them fine, I'll try my best. I went to get measured and paid a $20 deposit, but as the next few weeks progressed, more things came up for me, so I definitely was not able to afford it and I told him so.  He told me that one of our other friends, the Best Man, would pay for the remaining balance of my rental. I felt bad and told him not to do that, but he insisted and said our friend is doing it for him as a wedding gift, so I understood. After the ceremony, we took pictures of everyone and then did the reception, which started around 5:30-6pm. I left around 7:30pm. as my knee was killing me from a recent injury and was just super exhausted. I said my goodbyes and thought everything was OK.

Her death has hit me very hard because I was already in a depression before she died and her death obviously didn’t help. She was the only family member that I felt close with. I‘m not particularly close with my sister (32f) and very disconnected with my father (56m). I‘m slowly realizing that he was borderline abusive in my childhood with his huge anger he always expressed towards me. He‘s also not very emotional except anger, very contrary to me. My mother mentioned a few times throughout her life that she’d like the idea of her ashes being scattered in the Grand Canyon when she dies. Where I live, the family usually doesn’t receive tje ashes after cremation, they need to be buried. We managed to get a portion of the ashes though. So now the family has organized a huge family trip to the US that‘s supposed to last 3 weeks. The US are on the other side of the Atlantic so it‘s a very expensive and stressfull journey. They all don’t mind because they enjoy such holidays which I really don’t. I‘m never longer away than a week, and even that is rare.At first I obviously accepted to join, with my mother in mind. But now that the trip is comming closer and closer my fear of this trip is getting bigger and bigger. I‘m literally still afraid of my father even though his behaviour towards me changed a lot when I moved out and started my own life. We have respect for each other, but I honestly don’t feel love towards him and we never talked about any emotions at all and he never expressed much understanding towards my emotions that I mostly kept hidden (he doesn’t know I have depression and tried to hide that as much as possible, I don’t feel comfortable sharing it with him and I never thought it would be a good idea, same for my sister). My family organised it economically so i‘ll mostly share hotelrooms with my father which is terrifying to me. For no other reason than the past. He doesn’t get angry anymore since my mother passed. I‘m a homeboy and my privacy, my living space and my close friends are the most important things in my life that give me strength and help me through my chronic depression. I‘d be disconnected from that for 3 weeks, no escape, in a very stressful environment to open a closing wound of losing my mother. Now I want to tell them that I won’t join them after all.

I was totally shocked because, while he has spent some time around this group, I kind of assumed it would be understood that he shouldn’t go. I tried to explain to him that not all women feel comfy expressing their sexuality around other men and I felt that his presence would throw off the vibe. Like if we go, it’s more of a fun horny but having him there it would be too genuinely sexual. He just couldn’t get that my friends wouldn’t feel comfortable with him there. I wouldn’t go to a strip club if it was just him and his friends (unless someone else brought their gf maybe). I wasn’t expecting to have to explain why women aren’t comfortable around men and I did it poorly. I feel bad and I could have chosen my words better. He ended up really hurt and upset.

10v01e9,12,"I was getting ready for high school this morning. I usually eat breakfast, get dressed and leave. I have a schedule to leave my house to get to high school at 8:25-8:30 every weekday \[The drive to school takes around 10 minutes and class starts at 8:45\]. Only issue is that me and my family usually wake up around 8AM, most of the time I have only 45 minutes to get ready and get to school.At first, 45 minutes sounds like enough time for me to get to school considering I get driven there. Only issue is I am slow at getting my clothes on. Usually buttoning up my shirt takes me longer than it should \[I don't know why I struggle with buttoning up my shirt's buttons\].I made myself a coffee. I decided to get dressed as fast as I could while my coffee cools off \[I was dressing up quickly so I could drink my coffee and get to school on time\]. By the time I got dressed there was probably roughly around five minutes before I had to leave, to get to school on time. I ran to the kitchen, got my coffee and attempted to drink it quickly. My mum was in the kitchen and started to talk to me. I quickly put my coffee down so that I could talk to my mum before leaving. Since I quickly put down the cup of coffee, it spilled out of the cup and got on my shirt. My mum instantly got angry at me for getting coffee on my shirt. She demanded I change my shirt and leave the house to get to school.I changed my shirt. All I had to do now was put on my shoes and go to school. When I finished putting my shoes on it was exactly on time to leave. My mum has this idea that since I leave right on the last minute of my schedule, I will be late. She sometimes gets mad at me for being slow and leaving right on the last minute of my ""time to leave"".Since my mum was angry, she went on a rant about how I was too slow and did not care. ""You are good at using your fingers for gaming but for doing stuff"" \[By ""Stuff"" she meant ""Daily Tasks such as getting dressed for School\]. Then after my mum went on her daily ""You only care about video games rant"" she proceeded to call me a ""narcissist"".After my mum called me a ""narcissist"" I laughed my head off. Not a sarcastic laugh but a full ""laugh out loud"". It was not on purpose, I accidentally laughed. Reason I laughed is because of how my mum completely missed using the word ""narcissist"". How am I a narcissist for taking a while to put my clothes on?My mum got infuriated at me for laughing. Yelling from a different room about how I have a ""bad mouth"" for laughing at her. I left the house and went off to high school. My dad seemed to be on ""my side"" claiming that my mum ""Attacks people but then acts like the victim when the person defends themselves"" \[By ""attack"" he means verbally not physically\].

10v1h6a,29,"Update: after reading a few comments I realize I overreacted. We did enjoy the rest of our time and saying I wouldn't do it ever again was probably not a good way to go. I will apologize to him and well talk about what was really going on. Like a couple of you mentioned it's possible that there was a bit more to his frustration and well figure it out. Thanks for the advice. I was feeling really hurt and unappreciated at the time. I see now how he must have felt, I was only seeing from my POV and hadn't thought about his. An apology with him will likely go a long way to fixing things. But I really don't think I'll be planning another trip like this for a while. Someone pointed out our time differences and normally that's not an issue. My anxiety played a huge role in the sleep thing. And my explosive reaction to his comment. I do love him and we usually get along great. And maybe I should have tried harder to stay up longer. Thanks again everyone. I (35f) and my husband (37m) recently had a weekend getaway that we won in a raffle. I noticed he was struggling with stress with our four kids and decided to use our prize. So I secretly set up with family for them to take the kids and took off some vacation time for the occasion. Then the weekend before I surprised him with it. He didn't really seem excited but he's not ever really been one to show excitement about things so I wasn't upset by that. The problem began the first day we were there. I work 12 hour shifts and have major anxiety issues. So the day before we left I hardly slept and got up at 1pm, 5 hours before my shift, worked a whole 12 hours, came home helped pack the kids up and get them where they were supposed to go. Then we stopped and got dinner. We brought it to the place we were staying and ate. After we ate I got super tired. By this point I hadn't slept in 29 hours. I asked if I could take a nap and he said yes. After a 4 hour nap I got up and went to hang out with him and he was being quiet and didn't want to talk. That's when I asked him what his deal was. He said he was upset that I hadn't been spending time with him and I got super mad at him. I told him I regret making these plans, and let me just say it was a serious pain to get rid of four kids for two days, and I would never be doing that again. He got up and walked outside for a bit. I went and took a shower and he was back by the time I got out. He'd calmed down by then and because I didn't want to spend the rest of our time fighting I just let it go for the time being. When we went to get our kids he said he enjoyed the time and wanted to do it again sometime and I said I wasn't interested. I told him he could set something up for himself but I wouldn't have anything to do with it and that it was totally unfair how he acted about me taking a nap after all the effort I put into making it happen. (I had a hard time getting work to give me the time off) and he's been really quiet since then. I don't think I did anything wrong or am wrong for not wanting to do it again. So AITA??Edit to add: there was a little more to our argument than just that but I feel it's not necessary to post. And I don't have enough room to totally explain how hard it was to make this work out. We've been on a bit of a rough patch and I was hoping so so hard that this would help and the first thing we did together was fight. It just doesn't make me want to do it again, at least not anytime soon. Maybe I shouldn't have said never, but I was hurt and angry and I felt my efforts were totally unappreciated.",AITA for telling my husband I wouldn't be making nice plans for us ever again?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10v1h6a/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_wouldnt_be_making/
10uj5xb,49,"Some backstory first, I travel a lot for work and this happened while I was away for about a week. My girlfriend has social anxiety and recently had a medical incident that require some medication that she is now withdrawaling from, this can cause some increased irritation. My old FB picture was of the two of use but was about 2yrs old and I've changed my facial hair and lost some weight since then.Now that you've got that information here's the event. While away for work someone took a photo of the group and I thought I looked good in it. We work outside and I had been wearing a helmet so my hair was pressed flat and not how I usually wear it. I sent her the photo and she said it was ""nice"" but got mad at me about not wearing sunglasses in the picture to avoid snow blindness, she got very angry about this and said some mean things out of nowhere. I was surprised by this because she isn't normally like that. I managed to settle that over text and went about my day.When I showed the photo to my colleges I got some compliments. So on our lunch break I cropped the photo so it was just me and changed my profile picture, then went back out to work again.Four hours later she texted me saying that she didn't realize I planned to change my profile picture. She was upset and said that it wasn't a good enough photo to be a public profile picture, and that I violated the trust in our relationship by not going to her about it first.She went on to tell me how she showed the picture to her mother and some of her female friends and they all said it wasn't a nice photo. She said that her social anxiety was causing her to get really worked up about how the photo was public. I felt really shitty because I actually really liked the picture, so hearing that hurt. I also felt bad about upsetting her. In the end I spoke with her on the phone after work and she was crying. She apologized for being mean about it but stood by what she said and explained how the medication withdrawal was taking a toll.She also said that I should have know better then to change from a picture of us to one of just me after we had an argument earlier that day (I never really saw it as an argument).In the end I tried to comfort her but she is still upset and feels guilty about being mean.

My room is tiny compared to hers so I got my own bathroom as well so she’ll go in there and use my stuff. I brought this up to my mom and she said that she is still adjusting to the change. the only issue I’m having is the fact that she’s ALMOST 17, she’s not 15 anymore so shouldn’t she know how to ask? I talked to her as well and I said, “Sister, I would appreciate it if you could ask to borrow my stuff, especially my clothes.” I don’t want to sound mean but she is bigger than me, not overweight but a couple sizes up (I’m a L and she’s a 2X) so she’ll end up stretching my clothes and I have a difficult time finding stuff in my size because it is either such a common size or the stuff is genuinely ugly. She said that it’s because she is “fat” and I’m discriminating against her. I said that wasn’t the case and that she is welcome to borrowing my stuff but I would appreciate it if she could ask.

10uth2n,44,"A bit of context: wife is busy trying to advance her career, I have been nothing but supportive because I believe in her and she deserves to see her dreams come true. I take care of a large chunk of things at home (all the cooking, dishes, cleaning, chores, errands). I also help with work-related things, since we are in similar fields. There is one thing where I do not have acting power: when I moved in with her, she did not want to modify the lease so I am not officially on it, and I never had any contact with the landlady. My wife rented here for 13 years, and she always deals with the owner (who is a very nice, kind and polite person who takes care of the property when needs arise). However, she does not want to ""disturb"" the landlady when house maintenance is needed. Case in point, there is a leak from the upstairs bathroom (above the dining room) that has been going on for two years now: the upper part of a wall is bulging, and in the past months it got worse as water occasionally drips from a ceiling lamp, and from some small holes that appeared on the ceiling. I kindly asked my wife to contact the landlady and let her know about this, several times, and every time she would tell me: ""Now I am busy but after this ""*insert deadline*"" I will call her"". After the deadline, I would gently inquire with her and she would find another excuse. I do not feel I put pressure, as I accept her explanation and just wait. I offered to get in touch with the landlady and handle it myself, but my wife refused it. I have no skills to fix it, and even so or if I pay a contractor, we need the approval of the owner anyway.Fast forward to today: wife is hunting for jobs, with two interviews next month, so I should know better to be careful, however as we were taking a stroll in the hills, I thought about the water leakage (few days ago we placed cups under the holes cause the dripping is more frequent). I thought we talked in January, and she told me that in February she will contact the landlady but I was uncertain (after we had a similar conversation in November and she promised end of December). I asked her ""I seem to remember you telling me that in February you will contact the landlady"". Reply: ""No, I told you March or April"". Me: ""Oh, I am sorry, I remembered it wrong. Ok, March or April is fine"". To me the conversation ended there, but I realized that she was giving me the silence treatment. After some brewing, she lashed out, at first trying to get back at me and point out my ""poor planning and communication on the itinerary of our walk today"", and shaming me how ""I withheld information"", and then she got pissed on ""how in your right mind would you think to ask such a question, knowing how much stress I am under? Why would you put this pressure on me?"".

In total I’ve thrown away a couple hundred dollars worth of groceries. Seeing the fridge open yet again, instantly triggered me. I yelled out “Are you fucking kidding me” and slammed the fridge door shut. I opened my roommates door and told him. His response sent me over the edge. He responded with a sly “It wasn’t me”. Side note, I went out to eat last night and I’m 100% certain I didn’t open the fridge I came home and went straight to sleep. When I brought this up he replied with: “Well, before you go throwing everything out it wasn’t open that long. An hour tops. It’s not like I did it on purpose.” I was livid. I slammed my door and went to my room to gather myself.After a couple minutes…. I came out to throw away all of my food yet again.

Yesterday my sister mentioned she and my dad were thinking of doing a 2 week road trip this summer and I thought that was awesome, I was happy that my dad would be getting out of the house and having another adventure since my mom passed.

10uvfq6,13,"\*Throwaway account\* I (21 F) used to have a good relationship with my bio dad (48 M) up until around when I turned 12. He and my mom split when I was 1 because my dad was an idiot, and could barely hold down a stable job (he was 28 and had had at least 15-20 jobs at that point). My mom and stepdad married when I was 4, and I’ve lived with them my whole life. He's done a lot of stuff that I haven't agreed with over the years I've grown up, but it's too much for me to even put in here.In 2021, I decided to move in with him after college to get some life experience outside of my hometown. He never maintained his vehicle that I was regularly using, and expected me to pay for it if I thought there was something wrong with it. He gaslit me, and told me nothing was wrong with it anyways. In the end, it turned out I was right, and I could have ended up in a serious accident because of him. I also developed anxiety over this that he said wasn't a big deal.Fast forward to last night. I unfollowed him a couple of years ago on Facebook because I was sick of seeing his constant posts (I didn't block him because I did that before and he kept bugging me to unblock him). But from time to time, I'll decide to search his page up and just see what crap he's been saying on there lately. As soon as I start scrolling through his feed, I see post upon post of right-wing media that he's been sharing. There's everything from homophobia and transphobia to anti vax/anti mask posts to anti-women's rights (all things I'm in support of, and he was saying it was bullshit).To say I was shocked was an understatement. I knew he was a very political person because that's all he would talk about on our phone calls. He always said he was anti-right wing and he thought they were stupid. He was also super pro-vaccine all throughout the pandemic, and seemingly supported women's rights. But now, from what I'm seeing, he's the complete opposite. I assume it's from the fact that he is very chronically online, and only gets his news from Facebook and Instagram. When I messaged him and asked him about it, he immediately attacked me for getting upset over it, and told me I was stupid for not agreeing. In conclusion, AITA for not wanting to talk to him anymore? I feel like talking to him stresses me out more than I need, but my mom says that I have to let it go and come to terms with the fact that he's just an idiot and will never change. I feel like I would have a lot less stress if we stop talking, but I also kind of feel bad that I think this way. I wouldn't be losing much since I see my stepdad as a real father anyways.

I forgot them in her fridge while ex and I were still together and went on a trip. He wrote asking permission to eat one of them. Not one box, one sandwich. And I said yes.  Fast forward, ex and I split up, somewhat amicably, and in the process of getting our stuff back I go to her house and she goes “Hey, so the thing is that Kevin ate half of them” a whole box.

I ask her what happened and she said it’s not her problem, and that I still had stuff of hers to give her back ( she also has some of my stuff). I said, I am not giving you back your stuff unless he pays me my stuff; and that since those things might get a while, I was happy with the order confirmation. She said that why I were holding her stuff hostage if it was not her problem, and that I was an asshole. I, however said that he does not respect me and would not pay me back out of respect, but he cares about her, so it’s my insurance that I would get my stuff back. He also owes me gas money.

She also fed me, drove me twenty miles into town as needed, and paid full price for my first local psychiatric appointment.But: when my food stamps came (which I only qualified for if we didn't share food, as her income was too high), she expected me to buy both our groceries to repay some of her expenses and was angry when I refused to break the law. When I declined to give her access to my medical records, she threatened to evict me. When I told her a talk radio show she had playing in the car was lying, she told me that I was a non-taxpaying leech who shouldn't have political opinions. (She did allow me to vote in November.) She was also dismayed that I couldn't just call up HUD and get Section 8 to pay rent to her, and she disliked the delay in energy assistance.By November, she felt I should be working.

I felt hopeful for a moment and asked if I'd be able to stay long enough to take part. She said no, I was taking advantage of her.

Between that and her accusation, I said I'd ride along next time she went to the city and leave instead.Before I did, my grandmother told me I owed her $2500. I was out of her will and she wouldn't help me again, as she'd learned that I was looking into SSDI, which (2 Thessalonians 3:10) was an immoral, parasitic lifestyle.

I have what my podiatrist has described as the “worst calcifications” he has seen on my Achilles. There is a very high chance that with or without the surgery, I will lose my ability to walk. Surgery makes it less likely, but I will walk worse than normal, just hopefully without excruciating pain. The issue is causing my Achilles to not stretch properly and literally rip the top of my heel bone off slowly. Any course my doctor and I take, I will lose at least some function of my foot.The calcifications are 100% a direct result of tendon lengthening surgery my mother made me get at six to “fix” flat feet. The flat feet never caused me any issues. My mother claims I walked on the outside edges of my feet, but regardless it worked for me. In some ways I feel like my mom wanted me to “fix” the flat feet because they did make it difficult for me to wear “girly” shoes and they didn’t look “normal” and I was a major tomboy.But that’s beside the point. When I told my mom the doctor said my current issues were a direct result of the previous surgery, she got offended and said I was blaming her. She thinks it was a jerk move to bring the surgery 40 years ago up at all, even to my doctor. I think it was fairly important for my doctor to know and I was simply stating a fact to her that had the lengthening of the tendon not been done, I would not have the calcification to the extent I have it. Am I an AH for telling my mom (not in these exact words) that her decision 40 years ago is causing me to now face potentially losing my ability to walk?To be clear, I don’t think my mom is necessarily an AH for choosing the surgery back then. I do doubt her given reasons (photos and my medical records don’t fully support her claims, they paint a less severe picture), but I’m sure she made the best decision for how she felt about it.",AITA: I told my mom the major surgery I’m facing at 45 is a direct result of surgery she made me get at six.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tm226/aita_i_told_my_mom_the_major_surgery_im_facing_at/
10uwwmh,21,"Im 29F dog sitting for my sister 32 while she and her husband 35 are on vacation for two weeks. I agreed to dog sit cause my home life is bad and I wanted a break from it. Sister isn’t paying me. She left chicken breasts and hamburger meat in the fridge. She didn’t have much vegetables other than some carrots, celery, and tomatoes. She has some rice and sandwich bread. I’ve been making myself chicken and rice or hamburger meat with rice everyday. I don’t have a car so I can’t go to the grocery store. Her dog doesn’t do much. He’s a pug, walking him is easy and feeding him the same. I do go outside with him in the afternoon to play with him. He mostly chases me since he doesn’t know how to fetch.When sister left she left her house a mess. I cleaned the living room, mopped and swept the kitchen and vacuumed her house. I’ve been maintaining the guests bathroom clean since I’m using it. I washed some of the hers and her kids clothes and was putting them away. Going to put the clothes in her closet I saw that her husband had taken a shower left his underwear outside of the shower and the toilet wasn’t flushed. I feel like an ah for not cleaning that up or flushing the toilet. I like to have my space clean and everyone knows this about me. If I go to someone’s house I usually help clean cause I can’t stand seeing mess. But I do know that sometimes with kids it’s difficult and my sister has 3 kids a 10 &amp; 3 year old including her husband 35. He doesn’t help with the house chores cause him working is enough when sister works as well. Anyway sister didn’t tell me to clean her house I’m doing it cause I can’t sit and watch tv or work on my stuff while I feel dirt under my slippers. AITA for not helping sister ? Every time I think about cleaning her bathroom I recall her husband saying that my sister serving food to his sisters husband was wrong and overstepping and sister as his wife shouldn’t be doing that for other married men except him.

10tnmts,466,"I'm 23 and my niece is 14. Last year, my brother and SIL moved her to private school since she was getting bullied and she'd gone from an A to a F student. But even a year in, she was still failing. I knew what she was going through, I'd had some traumatic experiences from my first boss. And even when I quit, PTSD from that cost me my next job too.One day she called me upset about it, and I told her I could relate. My first boss was a terrible ""bully"" who really hurt and scared me, (understatement but I had to keep it PG) and for years after I quit I'd be as upset as if it had been yesterday. I'd spend my nights wondering if he was right, or I deserved it somehow. I asked if that's how she felt. She said yeah, and she really wanted to know how to make it stop. I told her that I started seeing him as dead to me. I'd never have to see him again. For all I knew, he might really be dead. But it didn't matter; in my heart he's been dead for a long time. She said she didn't know how to do that, they literally aren't dead. I said that this might sound a little woo-woo but there was an idea my therapist had, that really helped me, burning things that held bad memories. She wanted to try, and my brother said it was fine with him.So she put everything that reminded her of the bullies into a box. And if it was online, she sent me a link and I would print it out.Then one evening, she went through her box at my place, by my fire pit, and we talked a lot about each thing and the memories she needed to get off her chest before she burned it. Afterwards, I read a bit of writing that I'll share here for context later .. ""Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. All the universe gives us, it takes back in time. You've been given pain you didn't deserve, and you've been carrying it with you ever since. It's time to let go. This box, where you've gathered your pain, is but ash now. The wind will scatter it, till no trace is left. Let us lay (bullies names) to rest in your heart. Let this be the last their names are spoken, if that is your wish. That night, she thanked me for it all, and it had obviously been really cathartic. She also asked me if she could keep what I wrote, and I said yeah. She told a few friends at school about what we did, and the school administration heard and got concerned, some of it got taken out of context. The school called her mom (my sister in law) and she went through her things and found the writing I did, and she called me, literally accusing me of doing witchcraft, which I honestly started laughing at because if I was a witch I wouldn't be so broke. She was furious and said I was making jokes when I'd really overstepped, not being her parent, and it was totally inappropriate of me to give the advice ""they're dead to me"" to a kid about other kids. My brother agreed with her.AITA for the advice I gave, and was I overstepping?Edit... I was not expecting to have to explain this in the year 2023 but... Can we all please at least agree that1. Witches who can do death spells are some fictional Harry Potter style shit, they're not real. No disrespect to people who practice spirituality / wicca / etc, but that's not what we're talking about here, the kind of ""witchcraft"" my SIL accused me of doing was the ""Evil hag curses children with death"" sort that only exists in storybooks. 2. Even if there was such a thing as a real witch who could kill with their mind, I am not one, and I am not trying to be one. I said this as a joke at first, but seriously... If I was a witch, I'd be casting some spells to magic my bills away, not some little kids!! 3. I find it fucking ridiculous that I have to explain this to anyone born after the year 1650. I'm not gonna argue any more in the comments about whether I'm a witch. I'm fuckin obviously not, and I'm not trying to play Salem Witch Trial Simulator with any more crazies today!",AITA for my advice to my niece about bullies?

He went to school but only took a single class every semester and did doordash maybe twice a week for some income. He lived in New Jersey and I live in New York. The drive was usually around 35 minutes. Middle of our relationship he kept complaining I didn’t drive to see him enough. I tried to justify it by saying on my days off of course I wanted to spend them with him, but I probably didn’t want to drive and also deal with his parents. He kept complaining about the toll (Which his father paid for and never mentioned it). Yet he persisted. Maybe 1/4 times I would go to him instead, but again given my busy schedule, it was hard. He would also insist I pay for his food because he “drove all this way, it’s the least I could do”.

I’ve worked really hard on coming up with a schedule since he sleeps so horribly.I’m considering honestly skipping the dinner and staying at home.

My oldest cousin, I expected her partner to be there as they are married and have to children who are obviously my grandparents great grandchildren. However, I was both upset and annoyed when I saw my other cousins partner was there.After the funeral at the wake, my grandmother was talking to both me and my brother and mentioned that she would have ‘really loved for both of our partners to have been there’. At this point my annoyance came out and I brought up that I was really annoyed and upset that my cousins partner was there when we were told our partners could not be there and that in my opinion, if we were unable to invite all of our partners then in my opinion, none should be invited (with the exception of my eldest cousins as he is the father of my granddads great grandchildren). My grandmother then mentioned that my male cousins partner was invited as they live together. This annoyed me further as me and my boyfriend had lived together for 4 years and been together for 5 at this point, which is was longer than my cousin and his partner had even been together. I cried, they cried but it was all on civil terms, no raised voices or anything, just a very heightened emotional conversation.We all get on still but anytime I’m ever upset or annoyed about something, they make little comments about that time which I don’t really appreciate as it makes me out to be overly emotional and petty.

Once they separated, he and this coworker almost immediately started dating. Their announcement to Facebook was photos of them on the mountain where my dad proposed to my mom. This was before anyone even knew my parents had separated, so my mom got bombarded with calls from friends asking what had happened. She had wanted to keep it quiet. We asked both of them, privately, to take the photos down out of respect for my mom bc she was uncomfortable.Well, they did, but my dad called my mom and I heard the whole thing. He basically called her names and said how awful she was. So a lot of gaslighting. My dad did reupload the photos, and his girlfriend commented something akin to “Thankfully we can finally post these”. So this morning he called me and blew up at me over the comment. Said things like I was ruining his happiness and he deleted his Facebook account because I’m always causing drama on there, and how I hurt his feelings, refused to say “I love you back” (which he does when he’s mad). Yes, I’ve made clear my issues with him and his usual response is to tell me how I’m wrong and that his feelings matter more.He booked me a trip Saturday (so in a week) but after that call, I bawled cried to my mom &amp; roommate, saying how I didn’t feel safe going back there. (I live in California, he lives in North Carolina.) Both of them immediately told me not to go if I felt unsafe. I feel physically fearful and unsafe going back there but he already booked the tickets so that money would go to waste.Also, if you’re wondering why I would unblock him after all of that, I just wanted my dad back. He swore up and down he had changed and would no longer be abusive so I decided to give him another chance, and he proved he’s still the same.So AITA here?",AITA for not going on a trip my dad booked?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10v5yl8/aita_for_not_going_on_a_trip_my_dad_booked/

I had a girlfriend during our last one of these and she suggested the same thing but it was too late by then.Even though on paper it’s clearly a financially sound decision, the group mentality is that if you don’t do the duty free thing, you’re being cheap, and given my financial situation isn’t tight, it won’t reflect well. “Everyone else did it, what you can’t afford $75 bro?”So, WIBTA if I just bailed on the duty free thing, went into town the second I got there, and bought like 4 bottles for the same price?

10v5vuf,4,"I'm 34M, my half-brother is 39. He has a teenage son, I have a 1 year old daughter. We don't see each other often, but we call and text. He grew up without a solid male role model, his father was never in the picture, so he was somewhat difficult in his youth. My mothers general lack of parenting didn't help in this regard. I spent most of my time with my father and his family, visiting my mother and my brother on weekends.While my brother has little formal education, I would call him gifted. He is a creative person and he's very good at what he does. Unfortunately he is unwilling to think ahead or plan, he has a 'devil may care' attitude. This means his financials have never been great.Over the years he has asked me for loans several times. I never got the money back, and he never brought it up. He would just ask for another loan. The last time he asked for money was 4 years ago. He told me he needs the money for his son. I told him it's not cool, using his child to guilt me into giving him money, while he has had years to better his situation. We agreed that he can ask me for money 2 more times and that's it, after this I would be done with the loans. He used up his last 2 times and that was it.I've told our mother to stop giving him money, that he has to learn to take care of himself. When he recently got injured at work (disabled for a few weeks), he wrote to me asking for money. Our mother followed my advice and told him to figure it out, so he asked me. His son doesn't live with him, he has only himself to consider. I called our mother to ask what the money is for. He wanted to move to another city, to be closer to his son. He found a flat that was close to where his son lived. But he was not living there yet, he still had some work to finish in his current town, and he was recovering from his injuries. Our mother helped him with the deposit and she paid the first month of rent. He could not yet move and he wanted to keep the flat. It would take him at least one more month wrap things up, while paying rent for an empty flat. I found all this ludicrous. I wold have just canceled the contract and look for another flat. Yes, any other flat would have been further from his kid, but that's life. I went off on him. I reminded him all the previous loans. I explained why it's a dumb idea. I was annoyed with him for even asking.I don't really know if he understood me. He went back to our mother, she caved and gave him the money. In total she spent thousands paying for an empty flat. I feel bad leaving him in a tough spot. I understand the need to be close to your kid. I did say I love him to pieces, but that shit just doesn't fly with me. He hasn't been responding to my texts. Maybe I should cut him some slack due to his childhood. At the same time, it's not something one can hide behind forever.

10v266g,16,"Names changed. I (39M) play DnD (Dungeons and Dragons) with my friends and in 2020 I decided to DM a campaign for my friends to help with the stress. Two friends of mine are a couple, Matt and John (29M now) just added an infant to their family when I started my campaign. They shared a character at first to swap baby duty (this was over the internet with video call). Eventually, they moved to the same town as me and for 8 months they (Matt, John and Bubba) lived with me because their housing fell thru last minute. We started playing in person and they wanted to start playing separate characters once Bubba was old enough he didn’t need as dedicated focus. We found an in-game reason to split, no problem. Matt started having seizures and it took a long time to get them under control (it’s relevant). They move out, we keep playing off and on because life happens. Have friends join and leave, the three of us remain the core group. Matt’s dad dies.Matt forgets everything. Not just DnD, but everything. Total amnesia. He eventually starts gaining it back, but keeps having episodes of amnesia. At this point we’ve stopped the game because he doesn’t remember anything about the character he created or the game. Finally find out his seizures and amnesia are in part due to PTSD and he’ll have amnesia episodes whenever something triggers him. I suspended our game indefinitely while he works with a counselor to get the total amnesia attacks under control. He hasn’t had any memory loss covering more than a day for a few months now and he wants to resume the campaign. Now that the backstory is out of the way:I don’t want to play with someone who is constantly having to make new characters and relearn how to play DnD. It’s exhausting to have to incorporate a new character, only for him to forget and have to change the story for one character to leave and another to return. Add to that explaining the house rules, how to play, etc. However, he hasn’t had a major memory loss in a few months. So, AITA for not resuming our campaign now that he isn’t consistently losing his memory? WIBTA if I told him that’s why we aren’t playing?Two questions that might come up: He doesn’t remember the old campaign or his old characters.

10v0099,16,"TA account. For background, I am in a group chat with three friends and an acquaintance ""Mel"". I call Mel an acquaintance because I am not really close to her but the rest of my friends are good friends with her. Mel likely sees me as an acquaintance too. I have hung out with my three friends multiple times as a group but I have hung out with all four (plus Mel) only once.Anyways, Mel's birthday is in three weeks and one of my friends ""Daisy"" texted the group chat asking what we were going to do for her birthday. Mel said she wanted to go to an aquarium early in the day located in San Diego (where we live far from). The rest of my friends made the idea of hanging out the entire day in San Diego to celebrate her 25th birthday which I thought would be fun.I didn't check the group chat for a whole day but Daisy asked Mel where else she would like to go. Mel said she didn't mind where and would appreciate ideas. Daisy then came up with a list of things to do in San Diego which Mel agreed sounded like a good list. I checked the group chat after Mel agreed to go to the places on the list. I then see the list and look up the places online. After looking up all the attractions I see that they all require an entrance fee/ticket and each attraction costs around 30-40 dollars per ticket. Basically, I would spend about 150 dollars for Mel's birthday.I don't have enough money to be spending right now due to my financial situation. If I were to tell the group chat that I can't go because of financial reasons, Mel wouldn't care if I went or not. My other two friends would be understanding why I couldn't go but I know Daisy would try to start an argument if I said I did not want to go. I have an idea of what Daisy might say:""It's selfish of you to not want to celebrate Mel's birthday""""Money comes and goes""""It's selfish to not even spare some money to celebrate someone's birthday""""You're being bitchy for not wanting to celebrate someone's special day""I want to be honest and tell them I can't go due to financial reasons but I don't want a one-sided aggressive argument from Daisy. I would go for only the first part of her birthday (to spend less) but we'd be carpooling in someone else's car since the drive is far from where we live, so I wouldn't have a way back to leave early. Even if I lied and said I had something important to do that day, Daisy would tell me to attend the birthday instead and tell me that my important thing could be moved to another day. Thank you if you read this far, but is it reasonable for me to not go to Mel's birthday and AITA for not wanting to go?Also, idk if I am the AH for thinking this but even if I were in a good financial situation, I don't think I would spend $150 for someone's birthday who I'm not that close with.

10usklp,16,"In June, it will be 2 years since I was in a car accident with my mom. I was driving when a drunk cyclist came at a big speed down the road perpendicular to the road we were on (he was going down the hill on the right side of my car) and didn't hit the bike brakes. Fortunately, I wasn't speeding or anything at that time, so he only got a few scrapes when he hit my windshield. My mother and I were left unharmed.Since that time, I have my heart in my throat whenever there is a vehicle going at a higher speed, as if it were about to hit the side of my car, and I am not sure if it will stop or go on like that cyclist. My heart beats a bit faster, and my hands become sweaty at times when it happens. My first instinct then is to hit the brakes and slow down, even when I am not going over the speed limit.From the time of that incident on, my mom became obsessed with careful driving. She doesn't have a driving license because she failed the test and later on didn't try again (mostly due to lack of money and her bad sight). That's why I have to drive her around. Whenever there is a car ""going at us,"" when I am driving a bit faster, or simply doing some maneuvers on the road, she comments on my driving and what I should and shouldn't do.I understand that she was there with me and that she also has trauma, but I can't find a way to make her understand that when she constantly comments on how I should drive my car, it pisses me off and makes me even more stressed to be behind a steering wheel. That's why, at times, I simply explode and yell at her when I can't stand it anymore. Usually, it's something along the lines of ""Shut up; you're not the one driving."" ""You don't even have the license, so don't tell me what to do.""The last time I apologized to her, it was only for the part about the license.

I suffer from chronic depression and social anxiety, and it has been very hard for me to hold on to a job. I shall explain why.Ever since I was an infant, I was constantly emotionally, verbally and physically neglected by my father. I never received any love from him. The constant child neglect took place till I reached the age of 18. Everyday growing up, he reminded me that he would be happy if I died. Nothing I ever achieved was celebrated, heck was even acknowledged, I was constantly put down for my looks by my own parents, and was told nobody would ever love me or marry me. I was PETRIFIED of my father. After enduring so much trauma, I have grown up with severe depression and it even affects my married life. When I finally mustered the courage to talk about this to my parents, I was simply scoffed off, and was told that I was being delusional and to just forget it all. Since mental trauma isn't tangible, they feel they have done no wrong. My question is if in the process of the neglect, had I lost an arm or a leg, or be paralyzed, would I be asked to just forget it?Sure, therapy and counselling will help in healing, but it would be equivalent to putting on prosthetics or using a wheelchair, That would never bring my old healthy self back or give me back a happy childhood.So, now I have demanded for the 7k dollars as compensation for my mental health treatment and my medical bills.

He had a pilot's association lanyard and was chatting pretty familiarly with one of the flight attendants. We asked him and he confirmed he works for the company. We sat on the tarmac for about 40 minutes because of heavy rain that delayed a bunch of take offs and landings and he was on his phone the whole time.Soon after sitting down, my friend in the middle seat leaned over and said he was texting someone some nasty stuff about being seated next to two fat chicks but at least we weren't spilling over. I had a baby not long ago and I've got a tummy but fit comfortably in a seat and my friend is petite and stocky but again, easily fits in her seat. He wrote more stuff about us but she didn't want to repeat it. I've never seen her so mad.He was also texting gross stuff about the flight attendant he was speaking with earlier, telling his friend that the attendant looked like a bottom (both gay men) and said some other super gross stuff about how he was gonna bang this guy. He was also sexting with with several other men. The guy had his phone in his lap while texting. Like, my friend didn't even have to turn her head or peer around, it was totally visible from where she sat. We told the flight attendant that this guy was being creepy and was gross about us and him. He apologized profusely and thanked us for warning him. I wanted to say something to him as we left the plane but she asked me not to and I respected that.I do want to say something to their company customer service but my friend thinks that we should drop it because we don't really have proof it happened other than her immediately telling the attendant and us having no other way to know this guy sleeps with men.

10uwkf3,17,"i’ve been in various forms of a band with a good friend for the last 3 years, with him on drums and me playing guitar or bass as needed. for the longest time, we were the two strongest members and the lowest common denominator was always somebody else, but over the last 6 ish months we reformed with a new bassist and singer/guitarist (i play lead guitar). we’ve written some good songs and played a couple of shows, with another one coming up in a few weeks, but i don’t find myself satisfied creatively. the drummer is very difficult to work with at times, hes always suggesting covers when we need to work on originals, changing drum parts for already established songs, and his style doesn’t feel like it works with the music me and the singer are writing. generally, i have demos that are fully fleshed out musically, with a structure and general drum part in mind. the issue is that he changes the parts in a way that doesn’t fit the song and my intentions, i’ve tried talking to him about it and explaining that i write the way i do for a reason and trying to compromise, but it’s never worked. the singer is an amazing musician and songwriter who’s in another local band that i love, and working with him has been great. he has a lot of the same frustrations that i have, namely that aside from creative issues, everything is super unorganized, and as bas as it sounds that mostly traces back to the drummer. we really want to go off and form our own project, because we’re on the same page and work really well together, but i’m struggling to find a way to do it without coming across as a huge dick. this situation is even more complicated because we’re very close friends and get along well in that regard, we just always butt heads when it comes to anything creative. we have three weeks until our next show which is 90 minutes, and we only have 45 minutes worth of material ready. the singer drew up a plan for things to work on at rehearsals going forward that should work if we all practice alone, but i can see things not going as well as they need to. this next show and the lead up to it are really the deciding factor for me, and unless something drastically changes within that time, im not sure that i want to continue with this band. we decided not to schedule any more shows until we get our shit together, and we’re gonna have a band meeting and talk about refocusing after this gig but i’m really not confident that i want to continue with it going forward. i don’t feel excited for this next gig, i feel like it’s another thing i need to push through and get over and done with, which is not a good mentality to have. i don’t even know what sort of advice i’m looking for. i feel like i already have my mind made up, but i just need somewhere to vent about it and i’d like to hear some other possible perspectives on the situation. id really like to hear what you all think, feel free to ask for clarification an any part of this.",WIBTA for quitting a band with a close friend and starting a new project with another member of said band b/c i don’t feel satisfied creatively?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uwkf3/wibta_for_quitting_a_band_with_a_close_friend_and/

We all agreed months ahead of time that we would split the the cost of the hotel equally and prepaid for our stay. On the trip, one of my friends, Mona (names have been changed) hurts her knee and can no longer ski. She ends up leaving the trip one night early to go to the doctor. Lisa and I stay for the remainder of the trip. Once we get back, Mona asks that we refund her for her portion of the last night as “things are extremely tight right now &amp; leaving early fucked me both cost &amp; experience wise. I know me getting hurt was not expected, but I would sincerely appreciate it given the situation and recovery (more $ &amp; stress) ahead.”On one hand, I understand her situation, feel bad for her, and want to help. On the other hand, we all committed to and agreed on the amount of money we’d spend that weekend ahead of time and if she really was spread too thin, we’re close enough where she would feel comfortable expressing that. I also don’t think it’s fair for me to spend more out of my pocket and have to subsidize her lifestyle of living above her means (we all make around the same income - low six figured)1 - AITA for thinking this way?I talked to Lisa and she agreed that she didn’t want to pay more than what she originally agreed to as she’s also got bills to pay. I also am a little tight on money but spend less frivolously than Mona. Because I can help (even though I don’t want to - thanks to being a people pleaser) and Mona is one of my good friends so I understand how frustrating it is to have unexpected expenses, I offered to help. We had spent $400 on a dinner to be split evenly that I was owed money for from both Mona and Lisa. I told Mona that I would be happy to cover half of her portion for dinner (I asked Lisa to cover Mona’s other half but she declined) as a way to somewhat meet in the middle. She then got super passive aggressive and condescending and said she’ll pay for dinner and forget about asking about the hotel.

But between work being stress and me not being very close to him, I’m not too inclined to go.

This guy just spends time gaming 24/7, and refuses to relinquish his devices even when requested to do so at the dining table.

10v55x4,14,"Okay, this is gonna be quite the read.Early last year, I (21F) had my boyfriend (21M) move in with me in my college townhome with my 5 other roommates.All of my other roommates are women. We all moved in a year prior to my boyfriend, and I only knew a couple of them at the time. We all grew really close and became good friends-we hung out all the time. My boyfriend, at this time, was taking a break from college due to mental health issues, and living with his parents 4 hours away. He was very indecisive on whether or not he’d be going back to college (he goes to the same college as all of us do), so I resigned my lease with my roommates.On a whim, my boyfriend decided he wanted to come back to college but didn’t have anywhere to live. He couldn’t afford staying in the dorms, and definitely couldn’t afford living by himself. I also couldn’t break my lease, otherwise I would have just moved in with him.I immediately asked every one of my roommates if it would be ok if he lived with us. They had met him multiple times when he came to visit me, and was always very friendly and respectful to everyone, of course. Again, all of me and my roommates had grown pretty close.They all agreed that they would have no problem with it. I should also mention that another one of my roommates had her boyfriend living with us for a long period of time, so I didn’t think I was asking too much. Being the people pleaser I am, I continued to ask everyone to make sure it was really okay and they weren’t just saying yes for the sake of it. They all continued to agree, so I called my boyfriend and let him know he was in the clear, and he could live with us.We both share my room, and mostly keep to ourselves downstairs (we have a small extra living room in the basement, along with our bedroom and another roommates bedroom). One night at around 3:00am, two of my roommates drunkenly pulled me into the bathroom and said they needed to have “a talk” with me. For the next hour, they yelled at me saying how I was disrespectful for letting him stay there, how I didn’t take anyone else’s feelings into account, and said they talked to their therapists about me because it was causing them so much stress. And this was all centered around my boyfriend living there. Over the past year, I can obviously tell that they don’t like him. I don’t know if it’s because he annoys them, or it’s just the fact that a guy lives there and it’s uncomfortable for them. From everything that I’ve seen, my boyfriend is very respectful, cleans up after himself and takes out everyone’s trash, so I’m not sure why they don’t like him. He even pays extra on our electric bill. I don’t know what to do or if I’m being the asshole. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells around everyone and feel like everything is my fault.

10uhw8h,34,"I am the youngest of five children. My siblings and I grew up struggling financially, mostly because of our parents’ bad spending habits, unwillingness to keep a job, and financial illiteracy. I grew up so financially traumatized, I made it a point and focus of mine to never have to live a life like that ever again. My wife and I went to college, received our degrees, then worked towards the financial stability we desired.We purchased our first home last year in November. Not even two months in, my sister and her husband asked if their family (3 kids) could stay with us. Apparently, they have been struggling financially and needed to catch up on some of their bills. They were living day to day in a hotel these past few months. However, I learned they were evicted from their apartment for being behind on rent, and that was the reason they were staying in a hotel. Here is the problem I have with the entire situation. My sister and her husband have both lost multiple jobs for their lack of work ethic and maturity (fighting at work , drinking on the job, calling in too often). My sister and her husband are  10 + years older than my wife and I. Their current financial situation is 100% caused by the very same unhealthy financial habits my sister and I came from. Within a month of them staying with us I have noticed them spending more than what my wife and I would spend. That’s because we have a budget to assure we can save, pay our mortgage, and assure we stay financially stable. My sister doesn’t work at all. They eat out 3-4 times a week, have went shopping two weekends in a row, and have showed reckless spending behavior. My sister smokes marijuana and always has money for her stash. I don’t have problem with her smoking, but I believe your family’s needs come first before you get to enjoy things like that. I agreed to help them because I thought they were in NEED. IMO, you do not spend the way they have been spending if you are in desperate financial need. I have realized they are in their current financial situation because of the poor financial decisions they have made and continue to make. I feel like they are using me to live a comfortable life. They only pay me for utilities, and there is never any talk about plans to look for a place to stay.AITA for asking them to move out at the end of the month?",AITA for asking my sister and her family to move out at the end of the month ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uhw8h/aita_for_asking_my_sister_and_her_family_to_move/
10v52im,22,"I (32f) have a “friend” Hannah (32f) who was my best pal growing up. We had been through so much and she was honestly like a sister to me at one point and we considered each others families as our own. A few years ago while I was away visiting my long distance partner, my younger brother (20m) was attacked by her partner Vic (35m). My brother had been 16 at the time, and had called me asking what to do — I told him to call the police, which he did. Following this, I was furious with Vic, but the whole event was twisted to seem like it wasn’t Vic’s fault and that everyone was drunk (my brother definitely wasn’t) and it was just all a huge misunderstanding. I’ve always been a doormat, especially with Hannah, and tried to keep the peace but my brother, understandably, wanted nothing to do with her or Vic anymore. Hannah eventually split up with Vic, and I started to think our friendship might be salvageable. I then discovered Hannah is back together with Vic (I don’t use social media a lot) about a year and a half ago and I was just shocked. We hadn’t spoke for a little while anyway due to me now living further away, but we were civil and would do the casual “hi how are you” messaging now and again. I started to think that maybe that was why she wouldn’t meet up with me — I had visited home on my 30th and asked if she wanted to meet up to talk, but she never got back to me. It was a few months after my 30th that I found out they were together again. My 32nd birthday happened recently, and about a week before my birthday she had followed me and messaged me on instagram about a band we used to listen to. It was very out of the blue, and I had unfollowed her and removed her from my followers last year, so I didn’t respond. A few days later I had my birthday, and she had wished me a happy birthday — again, I didn’t respond. She messaged me again asking how I was, and I decided to remove her from my followers again and deleted the message without responding. I spoke to one of my friends about all this, and she things I’m being an AH. She said Hannah is clearly trying to reach out to me and resolve matters, and I’m being immature by just ignoring her. I explained everything that happened to this friend and, while she agrees Vic is an AH, she thinks Hannah is probably still all over the place emotionally after her mother passed away 5 years ago, and is only with Vic for some familiarity but that I could be that familiarity instead, and I think she might be right.

The friend agreed and said I could use the guest bedroom for that time, so when I got down I set my stuff and and stayed in the room. Well last night we had a group of friends over as a get together cause I hadn’t seen them in awhile and I thought it would be nice to catch up. (The home owners agreed to the party, I didn’t just invite people over to their house.) well the night carried on and we got to drinking, so everyone decided to stay for the night. It was really late into the night/morning when I got so tired I decided to go to bed before everyone else had settled down for the night, and while I was heading up to the guest room I was staying in, our one friend (We’ll call her Tammy) shot me a look and asked if I was going to the bed. I told Tammy “yeah, it’s where I’ve been for the last few days while I’m staying in town.” And Tammy just shoots me this annoyed angry look and just replies “Okay.” Very passive aggressively. Tammies boyfriend recognized this look on her face, and he just told tammy it was okay, they have an air mattress they can stay on, it’ll be fine for the night. But Tammy is now in this annoyed mood and just being passive aggressive. I just went to the room and called it a night. Normally when we get into these kind of parties Tammy and her boyfriend usually stay in the guest bedroom cause they are a couple and it doesn’t make much sense for the single folks to take a queen bed for themselves, which is fair, but none of the rest of us had prior plans to stay in the room. I know she’s complaining about it to the friends that own the house, but am I really the asshole for taking the guest bedroom even though it was promised to me for the week?

Let’s call him H.We were once talking online and I accidentally revealed that my ex was a girl. He asked me if I were bisexual to which I had a fuck it moment and replied with a ‘yes’. He told me that he was too. I recently figured out that the guys in my class talk shit on me on one of their group chats. I haven’t done much except given them the occasional side eye and shut them up a couple of times for saying vile shit. It wasn’t anything severe. I guess they couldn’t handle it.I was curious  and I NEEDED to know what they were saying about me. H was also on that group-chat. So I asked for his phone.The way they talked about me was just evil. Pure horrid intentions. Everything ranging from my looks to my marks was scrutinised. It was a rough read. I had never felt worse about myself. They were evil.After this H decided that he was gonna sort of create distance between himself and those guys. He would still talk to them in order to not be picked on, but just less.Recently, I noticed that he was getting closer to them instead of the opposite. It made me upset.One day I decided to be upfront and tell him that i can’t be friends with someone who associates with people like them. He claimed it was for ‘survival’.I called bullshit. You don’t need to be in their inner circle to survive. He NEEDED their validation. They were assholes when he wasn’t getting their approval, then suddenly when he got their validation, ‘they’re not so bad’. “Don’t take it personally, they say this about everyone” Fuck him for saying that.Not only this, all of our conversations now revolve around him. All. The. Time. The minute he has something to say, something he can’t share with the dudes because they’re homophobic as fuck. He dumps it on us and leaves. When it’s about him, we’re supposed to listen with undiverted  attention but the minute it’s about us his go to line is “Don’t think about it so much, go study. I’ll study too.”He also makes a lot of sexual jokes. I get that he’s never had a queer friend in real life before and he’s always had to repress his sexuality but he crosses the line sometimes. He’s made weird sexual jokes about the crush of our mutual friend. And the things is that he knew she REALLY liked him. I spoke to him about everything, he claims that he’s sorry and that he wants to do better. He won’t stop talking to the guys but he’s gonna be better about listening to us.

I've been in the office for about three years and get on well with everyone there, except one person. She (24 F) is the newest member of the team and we've simply never gelled, I get a very unpleasant vibe from her.She's been in post about a year, I made several efforts to make friends early on but eventually gave up as the gesture was not reciprocated. She's idealistic, self-oriented and often pretty rude. She comes from money and really looks down on the guys who've worked their way up from the bottom, me included. We all know our trade inside out and only a few weeks into her job she was rudely asking very experienced people if they ""even know what [basic industry knowledge] really is"". We're a close community and tend to sort ourselves out if there's a problem but on more than one occasion she's gone over people's heads and caused a lot of trouble for some of my colleagues. For these reasons I keep her at arm's length, it's clear to me we simply aren't each other's type of person.

I didn't include her on the invite list (email) because of the above, and I omitted a couple of older field guys because I knew it wouldn't be their thing. We openly discussed the gig around the office several times with her in the room (before I sent the invites out) and she made no effort to take part in any conversation (she usually pipes up with most matters) so I surmised this was mutual non-engagement.After a really fun gig, she claimed bullying by exclusion. The rest of the office that could make it had a great time and so did I, but on the following Monday I found myself explaining to her manager that I didn't ""not want her there"" I just didn't ""want her there"". It wasn't a work do, it was a social event. There have been no formal proceedings but I'm still pretty unhappy she's kicked up a fuss, which has brought about bad feelings to what I beleived to be a non-issue.

She then decided to, “start the process” by, starting to attempt to rip the posters and pictures off of my wall. She stopped after I told her to. Then, oh then, came the contacts.

Anyway, I woke up and went to the bathroom to put in my contacts, which are daily pairs, hey’re kept in a little storage box on the back of our toilet. So, I went to grab a pair, and….nothing was there.

So I blow up, to which she responds by saying it was my fault for leaving them out, how if I didn’t want to lose them, I should’ve put them up. I paid for those contacts with the money I got from my mom’s life insurance (it wasn’t a lot). If any of you know shit about contacts, you’ll know they’re expensive. I couldn’t afford to go out and buy a new supply.My dad isn’t talking to me now, because he thinks I’m overreacting. He agrees with Tammy, and says if I didn’t want them lost, they should’ve been kept safe. He’s also refusing to buy me a new supply, on her insistence. I asked if he planned to buy me more to compensate for the loss, to which he didn’t say anything at first, but to which Tammy said I needed to learn my lesson and some people have to learn the hard way that not everything in life is free, whatever the hell that means.So, TLDR; My dad’s girlfriend totally accidentally threw away my contacts, and then acted like it was my fault.

My sister made a rule about her wedding no kids under 5, which I think was a ""polite"" way of excluding my disabled child. My wife or myself would have immediately took her outside if she had a meltdown. As my 6 year old nephew (also neurotypical) just ""made the cut"" and gets to go, there's only two other children under 5 in the family no known disabilities yet. I understand her wedding her choice, but I'm not okay with including one of my daughters but not the other. Problem is my 7 yr old daughter really wanted to go, she's a real ""girly girl"" loves pretty dresses, princesses, fairies, and yes brides too. She was excited getting to see her aunt in a bridal gown (the last wedding she went to she was too young to remember). Since it is my sister I don't feel right missing her wedding so we are going without the girls and my in-laws will watch them that night. She's upset she doesn't get to go, and my sister says I'm fostering resentment but I think Im teaching my daughter it's not okay to exclude family due to a disability.

I ended up in the emergency room.Ive since recovered, but ever since I haven’t been too keen on driving. I sometimes drive alone if it’s a quick run to the store or just to aimlessly drive to get reacquainted, but fast forward to now and every time I suggest that I drive; my sister’s jump to suggest someone else or assure me that’s it’s fine and they can actually drive.I know they may not feel comfortable with me driving because of my accident, but I feel like it’s important for me to get over my anxiety -- i also feel like they kinda think less of me. Even before my accident my older sister would make little comments about me being a distracted driver. It always kind of irked me.So I took the next opportunity to force my little sister to let me drive, I wouldn’t take no for an answer and I ended up driving us down to the store. It all went fine and my little sis drove us back.The next day we were all together again and I proudly told my older sister that I drove and it all went fine. When I asked my younger sister to back me up she hesitantly piped up and said “yeah , kinda..”. That made me pause and I said “what do you mean kinda ?” I was a bit taken aback because I thought I drove fine and there weren’t really any problems, but my sister continued on to say that i ""stopped a bit early before stop signs"" and ""started slowing to soon."" I got frustrated and explained why I did those things because I was a bit anxious and wanted to not make any mistakes at all, mind you, it was in the middle of the night and the headlights on the car were dim, so I was being extra careful and watchful. My older sister saw me getting agitated and told me to calm down cause I'm the one who asked and wanted an honest answer, but I felt like my sister was nitpicking and didn't want me to succeed. Negative feelings started boiling up as I kept insisting that they were calling me a bad driver and they kept insisting that ""kinda"" doesn't mean ""badly"". I felt really helpless and I'm not proud of it, but I kind of started crying and telling them that they always try to make me feel like I do things wrong. I was upset and left them, but when I calmed down I apologized and told them I was just in a bad mood. I still am genuinely upset and angry because I don't feel like it was a genuine judgement when I'm insecure about being behind the wheel. They never encourage me to drive.

I don't like my hair getting in my face and asked my mom to braid it. Unfortunately, it was too short to go into one braid. So she separated it into 22 very tiny braids that start at the front of my hair and move to the back.

10tyql0,150,"I 38M have 2 boys. Mark 12M and Steven 16M. Steven recently came home past his curfew, but it's not a reoccurring issue. He's got good grades, helps out around the house, and is generally respectful. He's a big help and because of that we are a little lenient with him. Sometimes you're having a good time and time slips by, no biggy. Mark is also a great kid, but he's been doing things that are just kind of conniving?  First was Mark going into Steven's room. Mark told me with kind of a smirk that he found Steven had a pile up of dishes in his room, which isn't allowed. Once you're done with your food, I expect you to bring your dishes down at the end of the day. I talked to Steven about it, and he apologized. His punishment? Washing his dishes by hand. We have a dishwasher, but I felt it fitting to make him do it by hand. However, what concerned me was Mark shouldn't have been in Steven room in the first place. I get it, though. My older brothers room always seemed so cool when I grew up. But I told Mark to stay out of Steven's room unless he has Steven's permission. Another time, Mark came to us about Steven playing an inappropriate game. GTA V. My wife and I bought him the game. Mark didn't know about it cause we didn't want him playing it and being exposed to that content (yet). Mark was in Steven's room watching him play the game. He stayed to watch him play and told us later that night. Yet again, it seemed like Mark was getting a kick out of telling us. I sat Steven down and explained to him that while we are allowing him to have this game and are comfortable with him viewing mature material, I don't want him exposing Mark to it. Lastly was Steven coming home late from his friend's. Me and my wife knew he was late because when he gets home, he usually knocks on our door and lets us know. Plus, I heard him (clumsily) try to sneak in without us noticing. My wife was asleep at the time, so I just pretended not to hear and let it slide. However, the next morning, Mark brings it up with a grin. I asked Steven about it, and he admitted and apologized. I told him that if he was going to be late, he could have at least contacted us. I told him he couldn't go out for the rest of the weekend (I knew he was using the weekend to study anyway). The thing is, I want my kids to stick together. I also didn't appreciate Mark telling on his brother to humor himself. So I told Mark that since he enjoys telling on his brother so much, he's punished too (same punishment). Especially since steven admitted to coming home at a time  past marks bedtime. After the kids had dispersed, my wife told me she didn't approve. I explained that Mark is clearly getting a kick out of getting Steven in trouble, but my wife explained that if Steven was following the rules, he wouldn't get in trouble in the first place.

I am not mad about that because we were kids, but I am upset because Margaret now speaks to Melanie and my sister, but not me.

This week I had an interview, I had a principal observe me teach a lesson, I had a friend pass away this week. All while I’m still taking college courses, so I come home to homework in the evenings. My partner (25m) is aware of all of this and he is student teaching too. But he is not interested in getting a teaching job after graduation so he is not feeling the pressure near as much as me. He is also not enrolled in any college courses. Yesterday during the day, I texted him “I’m so hungry! I haven’t eaten real food in so long.” His response was “let’s go out to eat tonight! Or I’ll make dinner.” I said “omg yes PLEASE!!”I love when he cooks and I love when he takes me out. So I was excited. I had to stay after school for a couple hours yesterday to help my cooperating teacher with something, so I didn’t get to my partners place until 7pm. At 7:30 pm my partner starts making French toast sticks. Right before putting it in the microwave, he asks “did you want any?” This Immediately pissed me off. For obvious reasons I feel like. I was hungry, and he offered to feed me actual dinner. He noticed I was annoyed and asked why. I told him it was because I thought he was going to get me dinner. His response was “this is just a snack. I wasn’t thinking about dinner”. At this point, he said it wasn’t too late to think of what I wanted for dinner. But I was just mad at this point. It was 7:30pm and this isn’t his first time not following through on a plan.So I just grabbed my phone to order food. I am about to finish my order when he looks at my phone and says “so you’re not going to get me anything or ask if I want food?” At this point I was livid, all of a sudden, dinner plans were on me because he couldn’t follow through with the dinner plans he offered. We basically argued until I just walked out. AITA for getting upset over these dinner plans that didn’t follow through? Then trying to order my own food.

We established BEFORE we got the rabbit that it would be her responsibility to take care of it. She is supposed to clean up after it, brush it, feed it, give it water, all the necessary things for a rabbit. She took care of it up until about two months ago. She works different times like from 7:00 - 1:00 and 12:00 to various times. I understand that she works a lot, but she's still here a lot of the time. At this point she's doing it on purpose because she will be home on her bed (which is right next to our rabbits food and water) and asks me to change his water and give him food (I sleep further away from all of his things). I understand she works a lot, but she's never tired from work, she stays up all night on Instagram talking to her friends and blasting music on her speaker. It's really annoying how she expects me to always take care of HER rabbit when she should be the responsible one (she's 16 almost 17 and I'm 13) it just makes no sense seeing how I'm always taking care of her rabbit that she AGREED to take care of when she easily can.I'm always busy trying to focus on my upcoming play and dance which takes a lot of practice which she doesn't respect most of the time. She's always getting upset when I don't do it, saying that I'm not doing anything ( remind you, she's not doing anything either ) and never picks up the rabbit's poop, the food he spills, and never brushes him, she just leaves it all to me. I still try to take care of him but it's hard to remember to do things. Besides all that, she literally wakes me up at night or in the morning just to feed him when she has way more than enough time. I told her to take care of it herself and she got mad at me. I constantly try to make her take responsibility again but she won't have it, we constantly argue about it, but in the end I always do it because I feel bad for the rabbit. And her reasoning for all of this is because she's always working and she deserves a break from doing things since she's always taking care of us.

I know how stressful and overwhelming it can be when you’ve got seriously poorly patients.About 2 months ago I was working a day shift with another RNA and a ward Sister. My team was so busy that I barely made it through the day without a break down. I had 3 admissions within the space of an hour. One patient who’d had a stroke and was unresponsive, one having seizures who aspirated on vomit and a breathless patient that was struggling to breathe. While I was running around struggling, the other RNA sat at a her meds trolly on the computer the whole day. I’m not even exaggerating, she was sat there all day, she had no patient movement at all in her team and no poorly patients. She didn’t once offer me any help. On another occasion I had a patient admitted riddled with pressure ulcers to the point where I didn’t know what I was looking at and how to document them. I went to ask the 2 senior RNs sat at the nurses station for their help and they both fully ignored me. When I asked again they said they were busy.

They said I was overstepping.They said they wouldn't fire me ""this time"" because my tutoring has gotten Zoe's grades up and my rate is reasonable but they told me to think about what I did.I really don't think it's that serious and I think they're overreacting when I was just trying to be compassionate to their daughter.

10tkhvq,1026,"I (19F) just moved into an apartment with two other girls, Kayla and Maya (both 21F). Two days ago, I had my boyfriend Liam (20M) over, and we were hanging out between classes. We lost track of time while talking and realized that if we didn’t leave in the next couple of minutes that I’d be late for my afternoon class. I rushed to the bathroom to pee, and a moment later my boyfriend knocked on the door and told me to hurry up because he had to go too. We really didn’t have much time left and I still needed to brush my teeth and check my hair and makeup, and I wasn’t going to do that with him pissing in the bathroom. My mind raced and the only thing I could think of was to tell Liam to use my roommate Kayla’s bathroom, as her bedroom door is right across from mine and I know she doesn’t lock her door.Liam went and used Kayla’s bathroom, and five minutes later we were out the door. I barely made it to class on time, but I made it, so I relaxed and things went on as normal. However, when I got out of class, I had some missed texts from my roommate group chat. I opened it to see Kayla asking if anyone used her bathroom while she was at work. Maya had said no, that she’d been gone since 9 and wouldn’t be back until after a thing with her sorority sisters. I responded saying I didn’t use it, thinking there was no way she really knew that someone had been in there while she was out. I put my phone away and headed to the food court to grab something for dinner, then went back home, only to find Kayla on the couch watching tv. I said hi and just headed straight for my room, but before I could get my door unlocked Kayla asked “Why was Liam in my bathroom?” I asked her what she meant, and she told me she found ashes in the sink and a cigarette butt in the trash. Liam is the only one of use or our partners that actively smokes cigarettes. I figured at that point I was caught and admitted that I told him to use her bathroom when we were in a rush to leave. She told me that’s no excuse and reminded me that not only did we “violate her privacy” but that Maya and her have already asked that Liam not smoke inside the apartment. None of them like the smell of cigarettes and Kayla especially dislikes them because she grew up with a chain smoking father. I tried to apologize again and asked why it was such a big deal, because she never locks her door so what exactly does she expect? She told me she shouldn’t have to tell me as an adult to not go into her bedroom without permission, then got up and went into her room, slamming it and locking the door. I called Liam upset about it and told him what happened and he said Kayla was overreacting. I think so too, but she hasn’t spoken to me since and has been ignoring me. Maya has talked to me noticeably less as well. I’m wondering if I messed up here or if they’re just overreacting for real.EDIT- For clarification since everyone focusing on the smoking thing, the apartment is not smoke free. The entire apartment complex is smoke friendly. Maya and Kayla have no problem with Liam smoking on the patio or outside and disposing his cigarettes in my trash or the kitchen trash, but it’s in the 30s outside so I let him smoke in my bedroom because he shouldn’t have to be freezing cold while he smokes. It’s in my room so it’s nbd. And Kayla has let me use her bathroom once before so of course I didn’t think letting Liam do it would blow up like this. Also we have individual leases so they can’t “kick me off the lease.” They can’t kick me out for letting Liam smoke.EDIT 2– OKAY!! I REALIZE I WAS THE ASSHOLE!! I wasn’t trying to argue in the comments I was just clarifying things. I’m going to try and apologize to Kayla again. I just want to get past this.EDIT 3- I literally never said I’ve only lived with Kayla and Amaya for two days. I moved in a week before the semester began.

10uzt3t,13,"I (NB25) have had a tumultuous relationship with my father (56) since I was in high school. He used to have a pretty bad alcohol problem and did some pretty scary things when I was younger. He doesn't drink like that anymore, and so we've sort of rebuilt our relationship, mostly for the sake of my mom (56) who I am close to.My dad works as an expat in the Middle East and gets $19k from the company to leave the country for 20 days (it's required for his work visa). They sometimes offer to take me and my sibling, and this year they decided to go to Vietnam/Cambodia/Thailand. I've always wanted to go, so I said yes while my sibling said no. I feel very lucky to get to go on these trips with them covering the expenses, and I make sure to take care of the bags/finding restaurants/helping find things to do in addition to saying thank you and paying for dinner sometimes to show my appreciation.Onto the incident: About a week into our trip, we decide to go to a local restaurant for dinner in Siem Reap. The place is pretty much dead, with a few people coming in and out and 2 people working in the actual restaurant. While we were waiting, my dad picked up my phone and tried to get into it (without asking, mind you). When he couldn't get in because he doesn't know my passcode, he handed it to me and told me to start playing music out loud. I said no, this is a public space and I don't want to disturb other people (like the people working there) by playing music out loud. He got mad and accused me of contradicting everything he says/asks me to do. I can only think of 2 other times on this trip I told him no: when he told me to try intermittent fasting and when he told me to try being an expat teacher abroad to make more money. Honestly, these are things I have no interest in, and I don't feel like I'm just saying no to say no, but I'd appreciate some outside perspectives. I don't get along with him very well already, and now he's avoiding talking to me and won't look me in the eye.

10uo7xh,33,"I drive a 2009 Ford Focus that I bought from my older sister seven or eight years ago after I got my license. I only paid a little over $1,000 for it at the time, but it needed extensive repairs and maintenance to pass inspection, things like a new brake system and gas tank. I used to have a spare key, but at some point it went missing and after literal years of searching I've just accepted that it's gone, a point that will be relevant in a minute.&amp;#x200B;So this morning I get a call from my dad informing me that my sister (previous owner of the car) needs to borrow my car for the week as hers is broken down, and since he assumed I wouldn't mind he told her she could take it. Well, I *do* mind. She is not a gentle driver, and I didn't feel like being without my car for an entire week, so I asked him to call her back and explain that she'd need to find another way to get to work. However, an hour later my sister comes into my bedroom and wakes me up demanding my car keys. I'm incredibly annoyed, but since she's already here and I work from home anyway, I just give her the keys.&amp;#x200B;A few minute later she's back, and tells me she needs my spare key. I ask why, and she tells me that **she broke my key off in the ignition**. I say that there is no spare, it's been gone for years, but she insists that I'm lying and wants to come into my bedroom to search for it. I refuse, this is my personal space and the key's not even here. She stands in my doorway berating me for being unreliable when she needs me, and after some time I get frustrated and tell her to ""Just go.""&amp;#x200B;A little while later, I come downstairs and my sister is still here. My car is idling in the driveway, and I ask her if she plans to pay for my new key. She gives me a look, and tells me that it's MY responsibility to have a spare, not hers, and she doesn't plan on paying for anything except gas. This leads to a huge argument and she leaves in my car. I don't know how she plans to turn it off, or restart it if she succeeds.&amp;#x200B;I ask my dad how he could let her do this, and he tells me that since the car is in his name, it's technically his in the first place so I have no say in this, despite me being the one to have bought it, fuel it, and maintain it. To provide context on a previous point, I live with my dad but not for free. I pay most of the utilities and we go halfway on groceries. Being a self employed artist during these times, money's very tight and I don't have room in my budget to replace the ignition if that's what's needed, which from the way she described things might be the case. She knows this, but just chalked it up to me being irresponsible with my money.&amp;#x200B;I've since cooled down and thought it over. While I'm definitely mad over this, she does need a car for her job as a teacher, and telling her no just because of the way she treated her old car years ago was probably unfair.

Because I started planning this a month in advance, I sent reminders to my brother several times leading up to booking the room because he can be a tinge forgetful and I really wanted to have all my siblings there if possible to make a good memory. All in all I probably asked if he and his gf could make it 4-5 times before purchasing the Groupon to get the room, and every time I told him it would be on the 29th and around noon. The only concern he voiced at the time was potentially not being able to get off of work, which I totally get, even with notice you can't control if your boss is a dick. They ask if i can do it for 6pm or later but there are no available time slots and the ticket is nonrefundable, so I book the only available room late in the afternoon. Well, about three days before the 29th, he and his gf start giving my mom all of these reasons why they can't make it, none of which seem legitimate, and I feel hurt, but understand.

I’ve asked them to stop or at least tell me where to look, but they say that they can’t because it’s an automatic reaction.

He says a 3.5 isn't bad, but a 4.0 would've been better and by that point I just wanted him to leave. After that he quickly apologized for it and said he was making a joke but I took it too seriously. It didn't feel or sound like a joke to me so I told him that and asked him to leave again. He left me alone but he said something along the lines of that I over reacted and now I feel confused. Did I really take it too seriously? Was I the asshole to tell him to leave? I just felt so shitty. I did what I could and I put in effort and I showed up to school even when I didn't want to and there he was putting down everything just cause I was 0.4 points off.

10trzyi,333,"I(23F) have been with my boyfriend “Mark”(24M) for nearly two years and we’re thinking in moving in together and currently in the process of discussing what that would look like for us. Now I’m a fairly messy person and I don’t need to have our place look like a model home, but Mark’s dog, “Rex”(2.5) is making me consider ending the relationship entirely unless something changes. It seems that every other time I go to Mark’s place Rex always either pees, poops, or pukes somewhere in the house. Mark also allows Rex to crawl around under the sheets, which I think is nasty considering poop often gets stuck in his fur. Last night Rex ended up pooping on the bed, then immediately crawling under the sheets, and leaving a huge shit streak all over everything while we were in it and I lost it. I told Mark that it’s nasty he continues to let this happen and he needs to be more on top of letting his dog out. He said it only happens because he “gets excited” and that he lets him out enough. I suggested using bells by the door and teaching Rex to tap them when he needs to go out but he insists those are unnecessary. By that point I had enough and gave Mark and ultimatum: I would not consider moving in with him until Rex is completely house trained or he finds a new home for him. Mark said I was being unreasonable and mean by making him choose between me and his dog. Was I out of line for this? Neither my mom or I think so. Info: The dog is 2.5 years and we’ve been long distance until about 3 months ago so I didn’t know about this until recently. Mark claims he takes Rex out enough but I can’t know how often as we don’t live together. Rex is NOT a bad dog otherwise. This is his only issue.

10uqjhe,24,"My (21) boyfriend (22) of two years doesn’t like my friends. A year ago, two of them picked me and him up from the airport after break. My boyfriend’s mom had just passed away suddenly of cancer, and he had buzzed his head for her. It was a noticeable change in haircut, and my friends complimented it when they picked us up. He got upset and when we talked later he said that they had known his mom had cancer and should have thought about why he shaved his head before they said anything. He and I had posted about her illness, and one of them had donated to the family. He said that since they donated/presumably read the story about what was going on with her that they should have known and not made the comments. He never posted about his mom losing her hair or about him shaving it nor had I mentioned it to my friends. He has shaved his head before in a similar style, so it wasn’t unusual. Plus, not everyone with cancer loses their hair (my stepmom had stage four, went through intensive treatment, and kept her hair). I think he had unrealistic expectations for my friends to connect these dots. My friends knew that his mom had been diagnosed with cancer and passed away, but no details. Their words hurt him and I understand why— I never said that he shouldn’t have felt hurt. He thinks my friends were rude. I don’t think they were— they were being friendly and gave him a compliment. They had no idea that the haircut meant so much to him. My friends always say hi and are polite when they interact with him. They try to make small talk and start conversations. He tends to avoid eye contact even with the friends who he ‘likes’/haven’t done anything to annoy him and won’t speak to them unless they directly address him. He rarely says more than ‘hello’ and won’t greet them unless they greet him first. He is noticeably withdrawn and they (and I) find it rude. He told me it’s fine if I spend more time with my friends than him because they provide things for me that he can’t. IMO he missed the point— it’s not about time delegation, it’s that I want him and them to at least get along with each other, even if they aren’t best friends. My friends don’t like him much because he refuses to interact with them above the bare minimum, but they are friendly to him for me. They invite him to hang out and play games with them. I feel hurt that he won’t do the same. He says he doesn’t have the bandwidth. I understand that he is busy and has had a massively difficult year. I don’t feel that I’m asking a lot, and I feel like he is telling me that my happiness isn’t a big priority. I hate having to constantly choose whether to spend time with my friends or my boyfriend. I can never combine the two groups of people who I care most about, and I really wish he would make more of an effort. I told him this, but he feels that he is justified in disliking them.

10uea95,17," Warning English is not my first language so there could be mistakes. I (F18) got into an argument with my grandma and my aunt because I didn’t allow them to cut my hair. Today my aunt and cousin’s were here to visit me my parents and my grandma and to take my grandma back home because she doesn’t live in the country. She stayed like a month with us before she went home. I recently cut my hair really short and the reaction was positive from everyone besides my aunt. My grandma sent her a picture of my new look and as soon as she saw it she started texting me hair cuts she wants me to have and they are so totally not my style and she knows that. I already had a short haircut before and she said the same thing last time like “ oh you should do this or that with your hair I can even cut it for you, it would look a lot better than right now” to be honest I have very curly hair and it’s hard to really style it so I decided to cut it short. It’s a lot easier for me that way. My aunt herself has also short hair but hers is straight and she always has the same haircut. So my aunt sent me Fotos of hair styles for “black people hair”like Afros and like that I don’t know how to describe it another way no offence. The haircut would not work with my hair because it’s not the same hair structure. So she asked me if she could cut my hair that way and I didn’t want to be impolite after she asked me soo many times so I said yes even if I didn’t want to. When the time came for the cut I told her I don’t want her to do it anymore and my grandma got really upset about that, she said I couldn’t change my mind all the time and tried to make me feel like I was a bad person and I ruined her last day here with us. My aunt also got upset but said she didn’t really care and left the room. My grandma wouldn’t let the theme slide and still tried to manipulate me in getting it even after I told her why I didn’t want it and that I know that she is trying to manipulate me in to doing it. Then my father came into the room and I told him I don’t want to cut my hair, he said that it was ok and it’s my choice and left the room again. Skipping to when they left. I was in my room and my aunt and grandma came in to say goodbye just as they tried to leave my aunt made comments like I should stop being so stubborn and that I should change my character into being a nicer person and that I was selfish for not letting her cut my hair. I just slammed my door shut and didn’t say goodbye to her only to my grandma and cousin. I feel like I had the right to refuse but I also feel bad so am I the asshole?A little info I forgot to mention is that my aunt is not a hairdresser or anything like that she knows as much as I do about it and that’s not much.

10tddte,1283,"This happened last weekend but I'm still having arguments over this with my friend so thought I'd come here to get some outside perspective and opinions. So last Saturday one of my coworkers and good friends was throwing a birthday party for her daughter and she invited me. I asked her what I should get her daughter and she said that I should get a karaoke machine. But a few days later when I was hanging out with my younger sister who is around the same age as my friends daughter I told her about that karaoke machine and she basically laughed at me and said that no one actually wants that and she said I should just message her on IG and ask her what she wants instead of getting something she's gonna hate or not use. So that's what I did. She ended up sending me some links to some clothes and bags she liked and said that I should just choose one. They were all fairly expensive ones so I just chose the cheapest bag on her list which was still over 300 Euros (320 dollars for the Americans). Saturday comes and I end up giving her the bag and my friend saw that I didn't get the gift she told me to and asked me about it. So I explained everything and she was very upset with me saying that I shouldn't have messaged her daughter and that I should have just gotten the karaoke machine. We had a small argument and even her daughter told her that she never wanted a karaoke machine but my friend still insisted I was a ""jerk"" for going behind her back. She didn't talk to me at all throughout the party and even now a week later she constantly brings it up. So was AITA?EDIT: a few people have misunderstood our relationship, we're not just coworkers.

10un8xc,6,"I(38m) and my  (53f)girlfriend just had to get our car repaired and it came out to 1800$.  I have sent 500$ so far for a down payment and am working on getting more sent to her.  However her mom and son both owe me money so I asked her if they could help cover it.  She says I am an asshole for asking because her mom is poor and her son just started working and is helping out with bills.  So to add some backstory for clarity.  In November of 2019 my girlfriends son's cat had to be taken to the emergency vet because of crystals in it's urine, so the vet comes and says for the surgery and everything the bill will come out to 1200$ or we could pay around 200$ and have it put to sleep.  So after he (17m at the time) begs me and promises he will get a job and pay me back for the surgery I offer to put the money up front to save his cat.  The first week the cat is home he refuses to feed it the food from the vet because ""the cat doesn't like it"" and starts feeding it the original food.  About 2 months later the cat dies from urine crystals and he claims since the cat died he doesn't owe me any money and went almost 2 years without a job.  So fast forward to Christmas day 2020 and my girlfriends mom (MIL) tells us she got scammed out out of 5k$ in a car wrap scam from her internet boyfriend, so while dealing with that she borrows our car to go to Wendy's for my girlfriends son and ends up running a stop sign and Tbones another car.  The accident is ruled her fault and the car has over 8k$ worth of damage.  The good news is our car had full coverage insurance and a 1000$ deductible which I had  pay for.  The bad news is she refused to pay for the deductible or reduce the rent I was paying staying there.  I moved out in July 2022 and my girlfriend is in the process of moving down now, she drives the car between KY and PA about once a month going back and forth.  It's our only transportation, I pay for full coverage insurance on it and normal inspections / wear and tear etc.   So between the two I got stuck with over 2200$ in bills that they refused to help out.  Now that I am asking them to cover 1200$ between them, they say I am an ass because her mom is old and her son just started work back in August and I shouldn't be asking them because ""they can't pay it""",AITA for asking my girlfriends family to help with car repairs?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10un8xc/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriends_family_to_help/
10uo2le,5,"We've never had a close relationship for as long as I can remember. See, I'm a product of an unplanned teenage pregnancy and so I never really saw my mother around because of her aspirations to graduate highschool and then go onto college (she's a very smart woman academically). I can understand that she never had the chance to live out her teenage years due to me being born. I can understand why she might act the way she acts towards me because of her own estranged relationship with her mother. I can also understand the way she acts because of her mental illnesses and trauma. But, it is still so damaging to me.Recently, we had gotten into a huge argument about how irresponsible I am, how immature I am, how much I degrade her, how I'm sloppy, ungrateful and lazy after I came home late at 12am one time from playing D&amp;D with some close friends, even though I warned her I was going to be late due to my friend's mother coming home late to take all of us (my friends) home that night. She called me all those things and threatened to disconnect me from my social life and get rid of my freedom. I completely lost it towards her and started going off on her about how I'm trying the hardest that I am, how she's not being fair, and how manipulative and controlling she is. She's never here anymore, emotionally and physically. She's always going straight to the bar right when she goes home or going on dates with men at the last minute. It's getting to the point where I'm taking care of my 3 year old and 5 year old brothers whilst balancing the rest of my life -- including making dinner, bathing them, and more. In addition, I've dealt with her instability for years as she refuses to settle down. I have moved 14 different times-- in three different states and one different country, four different highschools too. I have given up everything multiple times just to please her. In the the past year, I have moved back from Italy to the states, a death for my grandfather, my other grandfather being diagnosed with prostate cancer and apparently having a secret love child who's only two years younger than me, my mother and ex-stepdad divorcing, being ripped apart from my girlfriend when I moved to the states, and dealing with my own severe depression and anxiety. I don't know what else to give. I'm tired.I've been in gifted programs all my academic career,  4.0 GPA all through, have almost 400k in college scholarships, never ever gotten in serious trouble, take care of my 3 and 5 year old brothers, cook dinner, active in three communities,  and clean the entire house.

10unyq3,2,"TW for faking disorders and severe mental health. TLDR: Friend copied identity and faked disability so hard our entire friendship group cut them off.Just to be clear there is no case of “you don’t know what they were going through” here. I’ve known this person since we were both young teenagers. We are now in our 20’s. I (m 23) met F in our early teams during a mental health crisis. F identified as a trans male and I was very supportive of them, they changed their name and identity a couple of times during our initial friendship period and I thought nothing of it. Sure, they’re young and figuring out their identity. During the time I initially spent with them we were both very mentally unwell, but I did notice some patterns in that whatever it was that I was struggling with they also suddenly also struggled with. And these weren’t trivial things, they were real diagnosed issues that required inpatient psychiatric care such as psychosis, severe insomnia and severe trauma. I lost contact with them during my late teens during an incredibly difficult period of my life which ultimately led me to be paralysed from the waist down in a failed attempt at taking my life. The past 4 years I have worked on myself. Hard. Attended intensive therapy, got fit and active adapting to my new life as a full time wheelchair user and have built a very solid support network around me of friends who also struggle with disability or mental health issues but are very self aware and a pleasure to be around. I’m very proud of the life that I have built for myself, I still struggle with my trauma but my adoptive parents and those around me are incredible, and I have been stable for a good few years, requiring no medication or admissions. I should also add that shortly after the “accident” I came out myself as transgender, and have been on hormones for the past 3 years, I live my life as a male and am indistinguishable to a cis man to those that don’t know me well. It was during this time, mid pandemic that F reentered my life. Identifying as their birth name and female. I had heard about them briefly throughout our years of not speaking, usually news that they had changed their identity again. F told me they were going through a rough patch and given my stability and own past struggles, I decided to introduce them to my friendship group, include them in all online social activities, helping them out financially and even finding them new living accommodation after they told me they were unhappy in theirs. Throughout this time there were no major incidents, apart from them constantly changing their entire personality to directly mirror my own except their gender and name changed almost on a weekly basis. I bought this up in therapy a couple of times noticing the inconsistency however felt empathetic towards them, it must be difficult having such an unstable sense of self right? The real issues started when the pandemic rules loosened and we all started hanging out in person. The first thing that raised huge red flags was that within a day of me introducing my friend with Tourette’s, F started ticcing. Weird little squeaks and head jerks that they claimed they had suffered with since childhood. It was overlooked until they met another friend who has a lot of difficulties with malnutrition and dizziness due to having deformities in their digestive tract. Over the next couple of weeks “F” was unable to eat. Claiming that they were suddenly having such severe gastro issues that their hair was falling out, they were passing out from low iron and suffering from malnutrition. This raised all of our eyebrows for two reasons. The timescale for such severe symptoms, and the fact that F is obese, regularly eats very well around us and was refusing to see a doctor.  Over the following months F became a sick melodramatic caricature of my entire friendship groups disabilities and personalities combined. Claiming Autism, Tourette’s, anemia, gastroparesis, heart conditions, chronic pain, neurological issues and a shopping list of severe mental health issues that didn’t add up. Schizophrenia, Bipolar, PTSD, paranoia, insomnia, anxiety, depression, agoraphobia… the list goes on. Anything any of us showed an interest in became an obsession of theirs. Mention a band and the next week they have their merchandise, video game? Posters all over their wall, someone dyed their hair? Them too. Except none of these severe disabilities impacted their life somehow. They held down their job, attended social gatherings, went out clubbing, and any time they joined one of our regular group calls we would be told how awfully they were suffering and then they would leave. By this time they’re well into the 20’s of pronoun and name changes. For those of us who are transgender this alone felt like a huge insult. Especially the rage attacks if they were misgendered. Even just suggesting that they shouldn’t be so rigid in identity until they had figured it out led to rage. Our approach to this behaviour was to not react, change our names for them without asking questions and every time they bought up a new health issue advising them to see a doctor or therapist. None of us feel the need to constantly talk about our disabilities, we have a great range of personalities and interests to talk about.This all came to a head when I was meeting a few of our friendship group for coffee. One of these friends (L) I had met in physiotherapist rehab, she has cerebral palsy and uses a cane to walk. F asks to tag along and I agree against best judgement. We were discussing university options of a friend when L had to leave, as she stood up she dropped her cane and whilst I steadied her so she didn’t fall L asked F if she could pick up her cane. Other than myself and F, the two others we were with were also either paralysed or severely disabled and wheelchair bound. L accidentally used a name F had changed a couple of weeks ago. F flew into a rage, claiming they would faint if they tried to pick up the cane, calling us transphobic and ableist and stating that if we couldn’t respect the fact that they were disabled in their own way we didn’t deserve them. Before walking out of the coffee shop. As we all froze in bewilderment and confusion a kind lady came and picked up L’s cane and we awkwardly decided to call it a day and go home. I reached out to F and their response was that they couldn’t control their behaviour as they were in some kind of episode. I spoke to my friend group the next day and they said they only tolerated F because I did, they made them all uncomfortable and the put their worries aside because they felt inspired by my compassion and tolerance. We collectively decided to cut contact with F and now only see vague aimed social media posts calling us toxic and abusive. L was so shaken by the behaviour they are now in therapy due to trust issues.AITA?",AITA For Kicking A Faker Out Of My Friendship Group?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10unyq3/aita_for_kicking_a_faker_out_of_my_friendship/

But my mother and I have decided to go ahead and take him and my brother in for a short term solution. A week or two ago I had written this angry, manic infused letter to the cousin who owns the home and today I posted it. It pretty much outs my cousin for her broken promise, which my entire family takes promises seriously, and outs her for leaving an autistic child (my brother) and my cousin who grew up in the home, without water for almost 2 months and refusing to send anyone out there to help. My aunt Church took my nanas debit card (which was for rent, food for my nanas dog, food for the boys, utilities, etc) and my nanas car keys which got my cousin fired from his job since he couldn't make it to work on time from walking to it. I posted it because it wasn't fair to my cousin that he could have been completely homeless if it weren't for my mom and I. And I posted it because everyone would do it to us if it were us in this case. But now I'm being told I need to take it down because it will ruin my cousins reputation as an outstanding citizen of the city. And it'll ruin her name. It'll ruin this, ruin that.

I swear nothing nasty was said about my roommate by either of us and we barely even talked about the issue for more than 15 seconds before talking about something else. I told her this but she said next time I should stay out of her business and what she talks about with her friends and left out of the room. I get where she's coming from, I essentially was gossiping with mutual friends about something that she clearly didn't want me to know about and I probably put her in an awkward situation when I showed up with a bottle of nail remover out of the blue but I didn't think it was that big of a deal.

10v22iw,26,"I am a dentist currently working 10 to 4 (unpaid internship of 3 months)I have been living at my aunt's for a month now. My parents house is 2 hours from the city where my job is at. So my father and uncle discussed and decided that it would be best for me to live at their house for 3 months instead of getting a new PG/ Rental apartment which will cost a lot for single person and the effort needed to move all furniture or other stuff might not be worth it.The decision to not pay for it or costs of various stuff was not discussed with me, it was between my father and uncle. I accepted it because it would be further rude to offer money after they have already told that it's fine.Now the main part is about chores which I feel guilty about which I am not helping out in. I still do try but there are limits1. Food My aunt usually cooks but I help out for dinner as I like cooking as well and sometimes cook as well. But can't help out in morning and aunt usually prepares tiffin for me and I am less of a concern as 2 of her kids (17 M and 14 F) live with us who are picky.2. Laundry/clothesWhen I leave in the morning my last days clothes which I left in basket are already washed and we don't have washing machine so hand washing is used, sometimes maid(2$/hour) comes to it, some times my aunt does it. I am not skilled for it. 3. CleaningAgain when I leave for work at 9 and return at 5 the house has already been cleaned and it never had been bought up. Maybe maid does it.The main thing which my aunt asked me to do 2 days ago and I refused upfront was ""Diva bati"" ( hindu prayer ritual), it usually takes 5 minutes, it is done twice a day in the house as a form of routine where you are supposed to light the candle and do the prayers/ritual.I have never directly told/discussed in house or with my parents/family that I am atheist. I am very confident that it will lead to a bad reaction as we are very orthodox.Before this there were times when some big ritual were held bi annually, my mother would me to sit for ritual even though I tried to make excuses so here at aunts house I wanted to draw the line from the beginning.But I still feel guilty since I am living for free and am very grateful to them.FYI + I ocassionally buy groceries, I do ask if they need help but nothing comes up from their end, also my uncle doesn't live with us so it's just me, aunt and 2 younger siblings/cousins who are in school.I also try help them study when I can.My aunt is a stay at home house wife but is trying to find work from home jobs and has a side thing going on as an  insurance agent.P.S for some who might recommend to be open about atheism, I brought this up once 5 years ago to my uncle casually when we were in car on highway infront of his friends and I got a 2 hours lecture about how great god is and how amazing our religion is. I don't want a repeat is all.TL.DR I live for free at my aunt's but refuse to do prayer ritual (routine twice a day) because I am atheist but they don't know I am atheist.",AITA for not helping out in a house I (25M) am living for free(food included) ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10v22iw/aita_for_not_helping_out_in_a_house_i_25m_am/
10ujp7e,15,"Let me elaborate here. I'm 21 and my sister is 19 turning 20 this year. Me and my friend Jay have been planning to move out together and we've been saving up money. We got a rough date of when we wanna move which will be the end of March. My parents have been planning go move to another city at the Start April, which is mostly the reason why I'm moving. I want to stay in the city I live in and they've moved to too many cities in my life time and this is where I'm putting my foot down and staying. My sister how ever is usually babied by them and they're staying for her schooling. So my dad got recent news that my sister's college course actually ends on June 8th and they wanna have her stay an extra month after that so they can print her out business cards and help her get a job. Which she needs, she hasn't had a job in her life. She can barely talk to people, she has severe mental issues and sometimes will run away. My dad HAULKED out at this news, absolutely furious that he has to stay an extra couple of months for her. Absolutely awfully furious. Throwing things like a literal toddler. He's a pretty toxic man. So their solution? Force me to have my sister move out with me when A) she doesn't have a job nor experience B) doesn't have any kind of income C) she's going back to live with our parents once she's done schoolEven if they do pay for her rent, I have to feed her. And if me and her get a 2 bedroom apartment...she's out in a couple of months and I'm stuck in a 2 bedroom apartment i can't afford. And I can't rely on Jay to move out with me at that point, I've already been pushing the moving date farther and farther. He told his parents the end of March. And if we all get a 3 bedroom we're still in the same crappy situation once she moves back down with my parents.. And I refuse to put out ads for a roommate (sketch as hell).

10v1y1u,12,"So, I (M18) had recently entered and left my first relationship (NB17). We dated for about two weeks before the relationship was cut off relatively suddenly, they had said they weren't ready for a relationship which while I was obviously upset by, I accepted the reasoning and was respectful about it. We were super close friends and stayed close friends despite the breakup. We had hung out a couple times after the breakup in which they were incredible close to me physically (not just in private). It had gotten to the point where our friends had to ask if we had gotten back together. After a hangout, I had asked them if they were still comfortable around me to make sure everything was ok, and they told me that I made them ""extremely comfortable.""Fast forward about half a month, us and our friend group had spent the day at our local mall. Note nothing bad had happened between us before the mall as we kept in regular contact (texting at least two hours a day). Throughout the day I was relatively close (no closer than I'd be with my other friends) to them mainly due to the fact they tend to get uncomfortable in group situations and they had established they were super comfortable with me. Also I tend to be physically close with my friends since we're all very close. Throughout the day I had asked them if they were comfortable and if they were ok, since they seemed to have some discomfort. I thought this was due to an access amount of caffeine that they had had earlier. They told me that ""everything's fine"" and that ""I'm good."" Near the end of the day I noticed they were being slightly distant from me in particular, so I backed off. I tend to struggle with social cues so I often need to ask if things are ok.The next day I had reached out to them asking if they were upset with me, they then lash out at me telling I harassed them and did ""everything in my power"" to make them uncomfortable and basically saying I'm a creep. I apologized for this immediately as the comfort of others is incredibly important to me, as well as explaining that I was trying to make sure they felt included. They insist my apology isn't enough and they don't want to see me ever again. Everyone I've talked to at the mall insists I wasn't doing anything particularly creepy. I do still feel very bad that I made them uncomfortable however I felt like they were very harsh towards me.After this I asked why they didn't tell me what was up when I asked them. The reason as to why they didn't communicate that I was making them uncomfortable with me is due to the fact they ""didn't want to make a scene"" and ""just don't like dealing with things in public."" I just feel like they're acting like its my fault I didn't know how they were feeling despite them very clearly establishing their comfort with me and not communicating any sort of discomfort when I had asked them. Everyone I've asked the situation about has sided with me however since they know me their opinions could easily be biased.

10v1vqv,55,"I’d 40F been in a 18-month relationship with my ex 39M. I have 1 child 12F to his 3 22F, 18M and 16M. Since his divorce, he decided he didn’t want anyone to ever rely on him again.We’d had 3/4 near misses with contraception but agreed we didn’t want kids. Although he’s undiagnosed, we’re both relatively certain he’s on the spectrum (but won’t be tested) which leads him to make literal but illogical decisions i.e.- He didn’t add people he was “seeing” to his social media (including me) but had no qualms adding female gym friends- Because I always cooked, he never reciprocated because he didn’t “enjoy” it. When I pointed out that I ended up doing everything so he needed to treat me, his rationale for not doing so was (a) he liked my food better than eating out and (b) if we’d done something, like gone on holiday- where I paid for myself - that was my treat so negated him needing to treat me- He planned a Spanish trip for 3 months of his sabbatical and didn’t plan for me to visit him because he’d be in a hostel and I’m a hotel/luxe personWhen I found out I was pregnant he just went into daily tirades about how his kids were enough, he didn’t want the baby, wanted me to abort and didn’t once ask what I wanted. He also told me he found me less attractive because I was pregnant and didn’t find pregnant women attractive (wk4 - no weight gain). At this point, I decided to keep the baby and end our relationship. I thought since he wanted our relationship to continue (and the fact that the baby was an inevitability) he’d face reality. Nope. He spent any time we communicated during the pregnancy repeating he didn’t want the child, at which point I cut him off and told him I’d want nothing from him.With the baby now due, I told him in an emergency delivery situation and only as a backup, I’d probably reach out for some assistance to which he agreed. He then asked for a delivery update because he “cares” about me the baby and my daughter. He didn’t understand why I thought this was laughable at best and antagonistic at worst. I pointed out, since he’d not demonstrated he cared at all the past 8 months, he didn’t deserve any updates. At that point I felt I’d made a mistake reaching out to him as a backup since he appeared to be giving himself credit for “caring” despite doing less than the minimum in terms of being a decent human being. I then decided that despite saying I wanted nothing and not putting him on the birth certificate I’d seek child support. Mostly because I think he has no idea how far short of any tangible demonstration of care he’s actually giving, but also because I could do with the assistance and it’s the minimum legal requirement.

10uvkqu,10,"I moved into a 3 bedroom apartment with a couple and a third woman. I thought it was a good setup, because the location is great. The roommates had jobs that would keep them out of the house for days at a time is how they sold me on it, (flight attendants) and I work remotely from home full time. They greatly overestimated how much they would be in the house and are constantly blasting music or their TV while I’m working. They can’t just close doors and no slam them even after trying to have a conversation about it. I work that 9-5 m-f while they work an average of 90 hours a month as flight attendants. They fly people into town with buddy passes to crash on the couch or with them for literally a week straight. The first conflict I had with them was me asking for them to clean my air fryer after use. They said they don’t ever clean their air fryer (the reason I eventually just bought my own.) They are big into the dj scene and brought friends over after at 3am and blasted music and sang until they passed out everywhere until 4am. Anyways the point of the complaints is I just decided these roommates are not people I would like to include in my life honestly. I just say hey to them when I see them in the kitchen or something but I don’t hang out with them or really say anything more than you’d say to someone on the street.

(11F) She had played in a chess tournament last Saturday and won first place.Earlier yesterday afternoon, my Daughter received a message from one her chess coachs telling her she'll compete in another tournament.

And her Father (We are divorced.) Gives her tips here and there. So, since these children have a much higher chance then her, my Daughter has been practicing a lot, which of course, means she uses her phone a lot.Since she already uses her phone a lot, I told her that she could not use her phone too study chess, and will have to do that on the time scheduled that she can use her phone and not outside it. She got mad and told me that it was for chess. She also said taht if she didn't win, she would atleast like too have 2nd or 3rd place.I told her no, and she got mad and has been giving me the cold shoulder all day. She must have told her Father, who is now berating me through the phone. In my opinion, he's biased as he was also a competitive chess player, and I also don't understand why she can just take out her chess board and study as opposed too using the Internet.So, am I the asshole?ETA: My ex husband (Daughter's Father) lives States away.ETA:My daughter's eyesight is already awful do to her accesive use of devices.",AITA for not letting my Daughter study chess with her phone?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10v1v5h/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_study_chess_with/
10urpsj,9,"So lately I've been getting frustrated with a friend who I've known for a long time. We text and message each other almost every day, but whenever it comes to making plans, he never wants to do anything and acts like I'm making some kind of unreasonable imposition. For example, I'll ask, ""Hey, do you want to go to xyz tonight?"" and he'll complain that it's too far, or he's too tired (this is the most frequent reason). He also says he has no money, even though he has a six-figure job that he constantly brags about to me even though I'm currently unemployed; last month he said he didn't want to go out anywhere at all to save money. But the thing is, he joined this activity a little while ago and now is telling me that they're his ""primary social group,"" and he goes to their events multiple times per week. It seems like he has all the time, energy, and money and the world for this hobby but none for me when I try and make plans like once a month.What bothers me too is that whenever I try and make plans, he doesn't definitively say no, but kind of strings me along and leaves me hanging before cancelling the day of. For example, I'll ask if he wants to go out somewhere and I'll get, ""maybe,"" or  ""probably."" He'll suggest a place, says it sounds good, but doesn't give a time, then a few hours or so before he cancels because he's too tired. So this weekend, I asked him and another friend (who is also flaky and does the same thing) if they wanted to do something. He said, ""what do you mean by doing something,"" and said that he was too tired from his hobby to go anywhere but was down to hang out at someone's apartment. I say why don't you guys come over to my apartment, I can cook dinner and we can chill out. He reads it but doesn't respond. The next day, as I'm about to go to the grocery store, I ask if he's coming. He says no, he's too tired and tries to change the subject. So I said, ""OK. I would've appreciated if you had just told me no yesterday instead of making it sound like you were coming."" He did not respond to this and I have not messaged him since. I'm going to give him the cold shoulder until he comes to me with a response.Was I in the wrong for saying that to him in this situation? I should say that we actually are good friends, and that I don't actually think this is a situation where he is trying to get rid of me.

But there was this guy I knew who happens to be her classmate and guy best friend whom I will refer as ""Rhys"" (PS. he'll be important) . She and I started chatting a lot, then I was told by a friend of mine that a guy named Rhys is super close with Emily, Rhys and I tend to share some clubs together therefore we see each other like a lot and nice to everyone and even me. One time I talk to him where I jokingly ask him if he likes Emily since everyone tease them, he laughed and said ""no"" I shouldn't be worried, but Emily was dating someone else from another section. But then things got a little suspicious when they were seen together a lot, not to be stalker but it was weird considering she was dating someone else. It was only a matter of time on valentine's day the two of them seemingly close intimately. I was shocked at first maybe a little heartbroken and jealous I must admit, I know she and I weren't really a thing we just talk online but it still hurt seeing them. Confused, I asked Rhys again if their together (at this point I don't know what to believe). Once again he said NO cuz he knows I like her, so I asked my friend eventually that the she and the previous guy broke up for almost a year, realized Rhys may have lied to me the whole time. I don't know why but I felt obligated to be angry not they're together or jealousy, but its the fact he lied to me and got my hopes up for nothing. I felt betrayed he was so nice to me and I trusted him. So the next day I completely ignored him the entire day, until he talked to me after giving him the ""cold shoulder"". I had enough and confronted him about it and told him he didn't need to lie to me cuz I would've understand and be cool with it but he didn't give me chance, I left and called him a traitor. Everyone saw and heard us (of course they did). It wasn't long enough when I heard stories about us, where I the 3rd wheel droving the 2 lovers apart.

Now, I am the type of person that doesn't really like all of that. Personally, I would rather stay home and rest because Graduation is the day after my last final. I wanted to recoup before I started my residency the week after. I get that it's just a few hours of my time but I have said repeatedly over the last few years that I wasn't going to walk.My parents have not paid for my tuition at all. I have student load that I took out to do what I wanted to do. They even tried discouraging me from pursuing the field I'm currently in saying I wouldn't be able to handle it. To be fair, I did what they wanted for the first 2 semesters and switched to a major I found myself actually enjoying. They deny ever trying to talk me out of my field and instead proceed to tell anyone that will ask about me and my career. But even when I have assignments to do, they have no actual regard for it. I'm the only child so I get that they need help around the house and I make myself as available to them as I can. I have no personal life because of all this. Between school, assignments, hours at the hospital, and my entire family (I include my aunts, uncles, and cousins in that group) I barely have time to myself. I haven't even had time for a relationship since 2015.

Everyone is making it out to seem like I'm a disappointment for not doing it, that it's every parents wish and maybe it is but I'm not a parent. I am someone who for the last 15+ years have been doing everything for everyone. I started cooking for my parents when I was 14/15 and cleaning the whole house on a weekly basis since I was 16.

I've always been guilted into family vacations (purely to be with/take care of my younger cousins) but have never been on vacation by myself and I never asked for one either. I take everyone and their feelings into consideration before anything. This is the first time I've chosen to put myself first and I've been made to feel like shit.",AITA for not wanting to walk at my graduation?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uoqqr/aita_for_not_wanting_to_walk_at_my_graduation/

10uopnk,24,"This is a throwaway, just because my sibs follow me on Reddit. Every Sunday me and a some family get together at my parents house for dinner. I got Covid in late 2020 and developed acute smell distortion where most foods, esp veggies, taste and smell rotten. I’m a vegetarian with mostly a vegan diet so it’s a lot. For 20 years my conservative parents always made my vegetarianism an issue and they make anything Covid related a political issue. Though they believe me and they can clearly tell I’ve changed (hair loss, terrible brain fog), but they have a low tolerance for how pervasive it’s been in my life. Our family are pretty excellent cooks and we love to make food for each other, but I can’t partake in this like I used to. I never expect my parents to change what they are cooking to fit my diet, but I will often call ahead of time to see what’s for dinner so I can bring my own food or eat before I go. But after i got parosmia, there were times I’d have to leave the house because someone was cooking with an “unsafe” food. It gets so bad that biting in to the wrong thing would send me straight to the bathroom to throw up. The smell alone is other worldly. So I started to go to their house less and less, and when I did, I would have a strong reaction to the smell so I would have to go into another room alone. This started to get on their nerves. I would try to describe to them how horrific it smelled to me, but I can tell they’re over it so I started to stay home more and more and decline the invite if I couldn’t eat the food. I got excited today because my sister was making a meal that I could eat, but then she told me that she was putting peppers in it. I used to grow and eat peppers but now I can’t even be in the same room if someone cooks with it. She offered to make something else or take it out, but I know they are irritated that they would have to change plans so I’m staying home. My mom complains that I’ve become so picky, but I have to remind her that she would have a difficult time too if all she smelled was diarrhea and musty rotting flesh covered in gasoline. I can’t eat my favorite foods anymore. I ask what they are making for dinner to be prepared, so when I get there and she’s left out the fact that she has cooked with foods I can’t eat and I have a visceral reaction to it, she gets irritated and says she “can’t win with me” (subtext being my veggie diet). I can’t help I have parosmia. I don’t at all expect them to change what they cook, but after two years of this, it does make me sad that they don’t really consider me unless it’s my sister (also a vegetarian) is cooking or it’s my turn to cook. Am I the asshole?EDIT to add: I have seen doctors and they have more or less told me it’s likely permanent after a year and several therapies failed.",AITA for not attending family dinners because of my diet restrictions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uopnk/aita_for_not_attending_family_dinners_because_of/

I responded with the fact that it was our wedding and we could do whatever we wanted. Jack backed me up, saying basically the same things, in more colourful language.We went home after this, and I started to look into getting married in Vegas, then having a non legally binding ceremony in the UK after we came back. I ran this idea past Jack and he was enthusiastic, but when he asked what his brother (42) thought, he was horrified.His brother said we were essentially lying to his family and that it was cruel to force their whole family together when the ceremony meant nothing.

She’s very sweet and caring, but, she’s very emotionally needy (can’t be alone long, needs reassurance a lot) and is very anxious (over thinks about everything so minor issues become huge deals), and, most annoyingly, seems to conform to everyone else’s opinions all the time. And, when I lived with her, I confessed to her that I struggled with an ED and was having a hard time recently with a relapse. She said she understood, and she had one too. That surprised me, because I never noticed that but, from that point on she would not eat and always talk about how she didn’t want to eat, and would buy the same groceries as me. She would say she wasn’t hungry and only buy diet foods. Naturally, this was extremely triggering to me, so I asked her if we could mutually protect each other by not doing diet-related behaviors or taking about not eating ext. she said she understood… but didn’t change her behavior at all…Well, flash forward to current day- even though I live in NY, she texts me every few weeks to tell me about a new horrendous illness she has.

He is the only one with a car and a license, as we live in a walkable neighborhood and I don't drive.Both of us make good money. He pays the rent, utilities, and our daughter's school tuition, and I make enough during the contracts I get to pay for the groceries, streaming subscriptions, and the many extracurricular activities our daughter enjoys (swimming lessons, cooking lessons, yoga, etc).However, when it comes to our home, we struggle to find the balance. I pay to replace anything we need, clean to the best of my ability, and had worked VERY hard (despite my mental health challenges) over the last few weeks to get the place in order, build and install some new shelving &amp; furniture (which I bought), declutter and downsize, and organize what we want to keep.My husband comes home and is very impressed! He said I did a great job and said, ""now, WE just need to keep this place in order!""Now, I get he works full-time and I try my best to be empathetic and supportive of him when he gets home. However, when he gets home, his expectations are food and TV. He doesn't put his shoes away, leaves his clothes all over my vanity (instead of the sizable hamper I bought and told him to put his clothes into), and rarely ever puts his dishes into the dishwasher (even if the dishwasher is clearly labelled ""dirty"") and will often leave them on the oven with food rotting on it until I come and clean it up.When I get annoyed and bring up the fact he could have put his dishes into the dishwasher or put his clothes into the hamper, he tells me, ""it's about balance. I contribute by working full-time and driving our daughter around. You don't."" My reply to him today was simple, ""it's not about balance. It's about capability. You have a car and can drive. I don't and can't, so I can't drive our daughter to places. However, all of us are capable of putting our dishes into the dishwasher, which includes you.""So, he called me an asshole...or actually a ""b-tch,"" but AITA for expecting that of him?\---**UPDATE:** Thank you everyone for your responses! I agree. I think that, while my tone towards him was definitely more irritated than I would have liked in hindsight, I am not the asshole here.Some more details:  I had asked my husband yesterday if he could finish filling up &amp; starting the dishwasher then take the compost down, because he was heading down to the garbage/ recycling area anyway and I was planning on doing the laundry today. He said he would but didn't, which he apologized for and said he'd do it the next morning IF I left it beside the door for him.So, that sets the scene for today. TLDR; I settled on the compost &amp; dishes not getting done until this morning.However, morning rolls past into nearly noon: dishes &amp; food are still on the counter, and even the entry hallways counter (which I had just decluttered a week ago) had become cluttered with misc stuff. He was sitting on the couch, watching TV. So, I dropped him a hint: ""am *I* cleaning the kitchen today?""""Sure! That'd be great!""OOF! My irritation grew.""Can you clean the scraps and take down the compost before you leave?""""Oh, yeah. Sure.""So, the morning progresses and we had just received some lunch we ordered to eat before my daughter and husband head out. As I entered the kitchen with the food, I was immediately irritated all over again. He hadn't cleaned the scaps at all-- despite knowing I have sensory issues with touching and being around old food.I grabbed a few clean plates, took the food out to the living room, served my daughter and husband their lunch, and explained to my husband that I didn't have any counterspace to put the food on so that's why the whole tray is here. He goes into the kitchen to get a fork, comes out with a small dessert fork, and says, ""do we not have any more clean forks?""I'm thinking, OOF! YOU DID NOT!I explain, in an irritated tone, ""That dishwasher has had the 'dirty' label on it for almost 3 DAYS. You'd think SOMEBODY would be able to just finish filling it and turning it on over a weekend. It could have been me, but it was supposed to be you! So why are you asking me about the forks?"" He mumbles something... and I go to the washroom and psyche myself up to overcome my sensory issues. I put some gloves on and begrudgingly did the compost and filled/ started the dishwasher. FYI: We do NOT have a lot of counterspace (sadly) and it does not take long for this place to look like it's blown up.After, I came back out and tell him, ""we could (all of us) learn to put our dishes in the dishwasher more frequently so they don't build up like that."" FYI, I'm not going to act like I didn't have a couple dishes I had left in the sink, too.He snapped at me and said, ""It's about balance! I work full-time and drive our daughter around. You take care of the home!""""Need I remind you of how I told you on, I believe-- was it? Yes. Our THIRD DATE...how I told you I am NOT, nor will I ever be, a traditional, old-fashioned housewife? I don't mind cooking, laundry, and light cleaning, but I suck at deep cleaning and stuff that screws with my sensory issues! You KNEW this!Now, I don't mind doing things! I may not always have the energy. You KNOW how somedays it's hard for me just to even get out of bed, but I try and I've committed a lot of time and money into getting this place streamlined. The least I expect is that all of us (not just me) look after it! I don't need you to do everything but could you at least help me, for example, cut out the part where I have to run around the whole damn apartment looking for your clothes that MAY be dirty, or which I may just end up accidentally rewashing for the 3rd time in a row? Or, better yet, just help me avoid washing something you want to wear when you come home from work? Because then I don't have to deal with you acting sulky because your PJs or crusty dressing gown are still damp in the dryer when you get home.""Then he motioned at the ottoman, ""Look, I took my folded clothes off the ottoman, like you asked, so all that's left on there to be put away are yours and \[insert daughter's name\].""""Yes, thank you. I appreciate you doing that and I'll get the rest done. But am I really so awful for asking you to help me maintain our home in other ways, too? The other day, you told my father at dinner I was doing a 'fantastic job' organizing this place and told me after I finished decluttering the place, 'now *we* just need to get into the habit of keeping this place maintained!' Did you mean the Royal 'we' when you said that?""Then he got upset, ""I'll tell you what? I'll do the dishes one week, and YOU take our daughter to her activies one week. I'll do my own laundry and YOU can go pick up the groceries (**context:** I preorder and he it picks up, otherwise I have to use my pull cart to carry it home). You really want our contributions to be THAT balanced?""I scoffed, ""We're ALREADY supposed to be taking turns with the dishes! And I'm sorry but you're the only one in the household who drives! It could never BE that 'balanced,' if that's what you think balanced looks like!""Then he said he was done and that it was time for them to leave anyway. He got up off the couch and started to go.It was childish of me, but I called after him, ""Oh, I'm *such* a terrible person for asking you to put a plate into a dishwasher after you're done using it, aren't I? How *diabiolical*? How *malicious*?! I mean, how *could* I even *dare* ask that of you, right?""""I'm going to the washroom now,"" he grumbled, ""leave me alone.""When he came out and went to our room to change, I followed him because I wanted to explain one last thing. He said he didn't want to talk.""I know you don't walk to talk, which is why you can just listen. It isn't about balance. It's about capability. You're capable of driving and have the car. I'm not capable of driving and don't have a car. However, we're all capable of putting our plates into the dishwasher or our clothes into the hamper (including me).

So, I dropped it so he could continue getting ready and I could focus on getting our daughter ready. I felt bad because our daughter had heard us arguing.""Is dad just joking?,"" she asked.""I wish. No. He's just having a temper tantrum, hon.""""Why?""""Same reason you sometimes do. Because he's upset. Even grownups have temper tantrums sometimes. We're not supposed to, just like you're not supposed to. We're supposed to know better, but they can happen sometimes.""""Why is he having one?

I read all of your responses before they came home and knew what I was going to say to him. When he got home, he was not mad but he wasn't interested in talking about it either. When I brought it up, he said, ""all I heard was you don't think I contribute enough.""I reiterated that this wasn't the case, at all, and that I made specifically sure that when I said ""we could **all of us** learn to put our dishes in the dishwasher more frequently"" to include the phrase ""all of us,"" because I had some dirty dishes that I left in the sink too!I said, ""I think you contribute a LOT! But you can still help by not making extra work for me where it isn't needed by practing better habits. We both need to get better at those habits! Especially if we want to instill good habits in our daughter. We both grew up not being expected nor taught how to properly maintain our living spaces. We're both struggling with it, but sometimes it feels like you're so invested in work that you're not as committed to learning these habits as I am.However, and I cannot stress this enough, I TOLD you I wasn't going to be a traditional housewife.

I'm going to let him sleep on it and discuss it with him tomorrow over the phone.Lastly, one thing I will say is (today being an exception) we usually do pretty well at talking with one another. He's been EXTRA stressed at work due to financial hardships over both COVID and the supply chain issues, and now we've just learned our poor daughter's school is nearly bankrupt and will have to close down in 2 weeks.

10ultxh,22,"I (f27) live with my partner in the UK. My parents (f58, m60) live in a different country. During covid, my father’s business was going downhill. He has been working his own business for nearly 20 years, so clearly he wasn’t ready to call it quit.Last year, he borrowed money from me twice. First time it was USD$6000 and the second time USD$12,000. I told him the first $6000 I don’t expect him to return, it was most of my savings but he can have it since he has been a good dad to me growing up. He also paid for my college fee for 4 years which was about $20,000, so I think it’s fair to offer him some when he needed it.Though the $12,000 is actually a gift from my grandma on my mum’s side when I moved country, and it is literally my emergency savings that I do not usually touch in my bank account, so I do expect him to return it and initially he promised to return the money in a month. That was August 2022 and now he is still working on giving the money back, every time I call him he promises me again it'll be soon. He told me not to tell my mum and I have been keeping this secret to myself for over half a year.It is a big sum of amount for me. I work an average living wage job and each month I make around $2000 that covers my rent and other daily expenses. I don't have much spare money and live a very minimalistic lifestyle, my flat with my partner is a studio flat that doesn't even have a bedroom, as in my living room is my bedroom.Fast forward to now, apparently my mum found out from my other relatives (on my dad’s side) that he has borrowed money from all 5 of them (like at least $12,000 per sibling if not more), on top of that, my mum and my grandma had also lent him money before by putting their house back on mortgage. My relatives are pretty mad but they already don't expect my father to return the money (they're more well-off). And they can't wrap their head around my father's action as he could've ended the business with the money he borrowed and saved his ass, but he keeps trying, as he believes there is a chance for him to save his business and brings it back to its good old days. My mum is really upset and worried but my father just keeps saying ""don't worry, I will get the money back and give it all back to them"".I didn’t tell my mum he has borrowed money from me because I know she will be soooo mad and my dad would be completely shamed. But I don’t know if I should keep covering up for him. Personally, I believe my father will return the money (at least to me, unsure about his siblings), but I don't know at this point. If I tell my mum, would it be nicer that everyone in the family knows? Or, if I do tell my mum, would it make him less likely to return my money too, so I should keep it a secret instead (because once the secret is out he won't be scared anymore)?WIBTA to tell my mum that my father borrowed money from me?AITA for chasing my father to return my money even though he has been nice to me and provided for me when I was a kid?EDIT, EXTRA INFO:Initially, when he was borrowing from me, he did say things like ""you aren't not gonna not help your dad right? Don't you trust your father?"" It did feel a bit guilt trippy but it worked, which is why I did lent him the money, now looking back I feel a bit silly. I really hope the trust isn't gonna be broken, considering he is the type of person that doesn't smoke, drink, gamble, he had a good track record as a good father until now. He also works 6-7 days a week now, seemingly trying really hard to savage the business and the situation.",WIBTA to tell my mum that my dad borrowed money from me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ultxh/wibta_to_tell_my_mum_that_my_dad_borrowed_money/

However, when it came to her brother a couple of years later circumstances have changed and I decided that we couldn't afford to have an adult living in our home for free and that he will have to start paying rent.He's grumbled about it a little bit but he's started to pay it. The actual conflict is coming from his mother. She keeps insisting that since we didn't charge his sister rent at his current age that it's unfair to charge him rent right now, and that we are just going to have to figure out how to make it work.

Sometimes I don't spend a long time in the bathroom because I want to, I do have certain issues with my bowels, that I've had since I was a kid, so it takes me a bit longer, I can't help it. But she got to the point where every time I want to use the bathroom she will ask to go first, because ""she will be done in two minutes""... Like, she would see me walk to towards the bathroom and come quickly and tell me to let her go first. And I do most of the time, if I know I will take long such as taking a bath or do my makeup, but sometimes waiting just isn't an option. Today I wanted to use the bathroom, I have been constipated for the past few days because of stress, and I was really happy I finally needed to go... And again, she said ""I'm not going to wait for you, I'll go first and I'll be out in 2 minutes."" I try to wait but the w minutes passed and my abdomen was already hurting so I knock at the door, and she opens as she was filling a watering can in the bathtub... And I'm like, are you done yet? And she said she didn't started yet, so I ask her to leave, as I go sit on the toilet, because I couldn't wait anymore. She gets out, but keeps reminding me trough the door that she's waiting, and when I get out she yells at me for walking in on her, I tell her that I said I wanted to go first because I knew it was an emergency, but she always demans to go before me and she should just wait her turn, but she said it isn't fair for her to wait after me when it will take her less time. And tells me I could hold it for 2 more minutes, but that's not how my body works.We do have a second, smaller bathroom, downstairs, that we don't usually use, the toilet was built on a platform so my grandpa, when he was alive, could get up easyer, but it's too tall for me to use it comfortably as my feet are sort of hanging. And tonight mom decided to get the stray dog she was feeding inside and let her sleep in the small bathroom, (while our own dog sleeps outside, but that's a different story).

10tvob4,61,"So. My fiancee has a bad fear of flying. Whenever we fly together she takes one of two options: 1. She drinks before the flight so she's tipsy and less scared2. She takes the local equivalent of a Xanax which basically means she sleeps most of the flightAs we are going on a transatlantic flight (11H) she went for option 2 with the hope of sleeping all the time. We normally always sit together and she holds my hand - I distract her with stories and we watch movies together... but here's the kicker: I have a business class ticket from work and she booked an economy ticket to join me on the trip. Her perspective is that I should give up the business class ticket and we should just sit together in economy, where my perspective is that it would be a huge waste of money and comfort to do so. Especially since she will likely be sleeping most of the flight I think it wouldn't make sense for both of us to sit in economy. Her perspective is that it's more important for me to sit next to her when she's afraid.On the outgoing flight, I checked in using business class, sat with her in economy during take off and then gave my business class seat to her so she could sleep comfortably during the full flight. I sat in economy throughout the flight. We are now about to go on the return flight and as I have an important meeting on Monday I need to be rested and suggested that I use the business class seat this time, checking in on her every hour and using the in-flight wifi so she can reach me if there's any emergency. AITA here for not just giving up the seat? Curious what other people would do in this situation.EDIT to clarify some stuff:1. Yes this a business trip for me. We thought we could upgrade my fiancee before the flight at a reduced fare but the prices went through the roof. We took a holiday after the business trip.2. My fiancee would be ok to sit in economy together - she's not ""just trying to get the business class ticket"". My thinking on the outgoing flight was that she would be able to sleep all the time in the business class seat, where in economy that's harder with the lack of recline etc.3. It's easy to move back and forth between business and economy. On the outgoing flight we sat next to each other whenever we weren't sleeping and my plan is to do the same now regardless of who sits where. My fiancee would just prefer to sit next to each other all the time.4. Flight time was 11H not 14H.

Our mother (77f) has various age-related health issues, &amp; I live alone w/ her as her primary caretaker, &amp; have done so for many years. K helps out occasionally as well, bc she lives nearby, but L lives pretty far away in neighboring state so only comes to visit occasionally. L also has three young kids that keep her busy, &amp; a chronic illness that is exacerbated by stress. She rarely ever expresses interest in mom during our conversations, &amp; even when she comes into town she only visits w/ Mom for the bare minimum of a few minutes here &amp; there, being more interested in catching up w/ old friends.Well, a few weeks ago during some routine tests, we found out that mom has a cyst on her liver &amp; we would need to  follow up w/ a specialist doctor.  At this point, we don't know much so we decide not to mention anything to L until we have something more definitive, not wanting to worry her.Fast forward three weeks, &amp; we get mom into the specialist, who orders another scan &amp; gives a referral for a potential liver biopsy. At this point we know a bit more, but still nothing definitive.  Nevertheless, we decide to tell  L what we know, since she is waffling about a planned trip to visit us for Mom's birthday, &amp; it seems relevant. K volunteers to talk to her about it bc I had been very sick myself the past week (couldn't barely get out of bed) &amp; I also had a big remote work deadline on Wednesday that I was still trying to complete (from my bed).Well on Monday, after the appointment, mom texts L basically saying 'I saw the doctor today’, bc that's about the extent of her ability to text in her old age.Naturally L asked me what happened, but again I'm sick &amp; trying to meet my deadline, so I tell her that K will call her in a day or so to chat, since K planned to anyways.  I don't give it any more thought, until Wednesday when L reached out in group chat w/ me &amp; K to express aggravation at still not being in the loop. K calls L but L doesn't pick up bc she's aggravated, so K just texts the details in the group chat. L seemed aggravated but overall ok.

10uj5yl,23,"Long time lurker, first time poster in here. Quick context for reference. My spouse has been in and out of mental health/rehab facilities for the last 14 months. For a total of 9 months being gone. I work full time, and we have a nearly 3 year old child. So, as you could imagine, I’ve been pretty much a single parent during this entire time. With only my income to support us all. It’s stressful, and tiring. But I’m doing my best. Recently, my In-laws have gifted us  an all-expense paid trip to a major theme park nearby. By spouse is currently in a facility again. The trip was originally planned with my spouse in mind, and tickets were purchased for them to be able to go as well. My in-laws have already bought their plane tickets, hotel, the whole thing. My spouse is now telling me that they do not want me to go because “they will be missing the first trip with our child to this park.” My spouse has missed many first time things up to this point. But is making me feel extremely guilty for going, and that I’ll have to deal with the “repercussions.” WIBTAH for going?

At one point he said him and a couple friends had to go to the car to get something real quick. I said okay but to try to hurry back. He ended up leaving me for 30 minutes. While he was gone I was talking to one of the girls and she asked where he went and I said he had to go get something from the car. One of the other girls heard and said they actually went outside to smoke. He knows for personal reasons I’m not big on him smoking, but I’m not in charge of what he does. I was however upset about him lying. A few minutes later one of the girls came up to me and said something like “I’m glad you guys finally stayed for a few! usually he just stops by for a couple minutes to smoke.” I knew nothing about this because he tells me he goes home after his games. I should mention we’ve had issues in the past with him “withholding information” and him saying it’s not lying cus I didn’t directly ask. I causally brought it up to him to hear his side and he started yelling at me for considering believing it. Now the argument is flipped on me and he’s saying I’m in the wrong for accusing him.

10u4lfm,31,"I effectively evicted my daughter and her new husband (they got married in Sept 2022) in January 2023.Why? I bailed them out of an entire year's rent &amp; utilities from their prior landlord in a city where my daughter was SUPPOSED to going college (but did not attend single day)! Unfortunately, I was a co-signator for the apartment. I was sending THEM - not the landlord - 50% of the rent. They not only did not pay their half - they spent my money too. By my math, that means I paid 150% of their rent for the entire year!!! Why the landlord did not contact me before I dragged them home I will never know.I also bought them a car in 2021 (which they managed to write-off, against my insurance! Stupidly, I replaced it in 2022 an even more expensive one) so that they could to work ... And obviously I've been paying the tax, insurance and maintenance the car(s) too!!! I've also been paying their phone bills since 2021! (latter one ends one ends the 13th Feb).The ""rent crisis"" was August 2022, and at that stage I was already knee deep in paying for their wedding (September 2022) :(Despite that, in August 2022, I told them that they could stay (more or less indefinitely) as long as they both got jobs and as a couple, they paid me at least $100 per week towards the debt (btw - ""cheap"" 1 bed apartments go for $1200 per month around here). I also stated that I expected them to save the same amount for when they moved out. Assuming both of the above were met, I said we would waive any rent/utilities, but I simply expected them to sweep the deck, keep their ROOMS clean (we gave them an entire 3-room floor/""mother-in-law apartment"" to themselves) and clean up after their dog - Not even make their own meals - just tell us what sort of food they wanted to eat.January ... No deck sweeping in 4 months. 1 cleanup after their dog (within a week there was 13 turds on the deck - not even fenced in yard! ... Seriously???)No debt payments; No utility payments; No rent payments ... They didn't even pay off their own overdraft! But they had lots of money to buy 7 or 8 large lego sets! (Those things are least $100 each).We had told them twice a month since start October (so that there was no additional stress during the wedding in September) that the debt repayment &amp; chores were a minimum to stay.Jan 5th, we very clearly reiterated the statementabove, and said that if we did not see chores and debt repayments on a weekly basis, we would assume they had chosen to leave.They disappeared overnight in mid january, and are now telling our family, friends and neighbours that ""we bullied them and then kicked them out"".Please tell where I wrong?

She got kind of sad and said that she wanted daddy to help her and that I didn't know what she liked. I told her I could be just as good as her dad.

Friday, my mom invited myself and siblings for dinner. I asked ahead of time for the menu so I knew what I could eat and if I needed to bring something else to keep to my diet. My mom said oh no worries they are cutting back too and it's a healthy meal. (Side note she does know my diet as we have discussed it low carb high protein lean meat no sugar.) Okay I trust her. Well the dinner comes and mom serves a salad first. Okay fine I picked out the croutons doing great so far. The main meal is porkchops cooked in a ready gravy, so packed with sugars and carbs with potatoes, and rolls with cake and ice cream for dessert. I'm looking and cant eat any of this.

Currently she understands English, Portuguese, Spanish and a little Italian. Recently, my husband said that I should invest in another hobby with our daughter, as studying languages ​​is not very common and he felt left out. He also said he wished we only spoke English at home as he didn't understand the other languages ​​and again said he felt left out. When I asked what he wanted us to do with him, he suggested trips (only countries he liked), games and family time. I replied that if he wanted to spend more time with her he should show interest in her hobby even if it wasn't that common instead of just being jealous. After that night he hasn't spoken to me properly and said he expects an apology from me.

10uhi30,29," I apologize for any errors as english is not my first language.I’m feeling extremely conflicted about this situation and since last time this place helped a lot I’m hoping to get new perspectives. So essentially, one of my friends invited my wife (f24) and I(m27) on a skii trip this upcoming week. He’s booking an entire cabin and inviting a lot of our other friends as well. This invitation is extremely sudden (happened this friday)  since we’ve had a looooot of snowfall in our country in the past week so it's the best time to go skiing. Both my wife and I absolutely ***love*** skiing, but for the past 2 years we sadly couldn’t go at all. In 2020, 2021 it was the whole pandemic issue. In 2022 we had to take care of our newborn son and decided it was best not to go. We both miss skiing. The issue is she can’t come this week. She has a law school exam this week and another one the week after. She’ll only have a break between semesters during the last week of February. That week I doubt I can take a vacation from work because a lot of other doctors have already booked that period and the hospital would be severely understaffed. It's honestly a lot easier for me to do it now. Plus I don’t know how the snow will be by then. We had little to no snowfall until last week. Right now the snow is perfect from what I've heard but who knows what it'll be like in a month. So yeah, I've been overworked the past few months (think 6 days a week all of December and January) and I really miss skiing.

She and her friends were cleaning a community centre after a party. I said: ""I was sleeping, why are you waking me up?"" Then I heared laughing in the phone and I felt like they don't care about my sleep and my needs. I said: ""Fine"" and I hung up the phone. I went there and I am sure I looked angry.

I said I was sleeping and now I won't fall asleep again and I am gonna be tired the rest of a day. Then she said her friends have something with their arms. That they can't carry heavy kegs.

I believe she is married to the owner but I’m not 100% sure. I have always allowed my daughter to choose how much she wants to bundle up when it’s cold. She’s very cold tolerant and complains that coats and even hoodies make her too hot in the winter, so most days she wears t shirts. We live in the southwest so it only dips to 40 degrees or so, not too bad. Megan has made it her mission to make sure all the kids at the dojo wear winter coats. For the last month, when she sees my daughter or any other kid not wearing a coat, she nags them to start bringing and wearing their coat. I’ve blown it off because it’s just another nosy old lady telling kids they need to bundle up, it’s whatever. Last week she flipped out on all the kids and yelled at the entire class that she’s been asking for weeks for kids to wear their coats. I mean YELLED. Then she made a big show of giving out prizes to the kids who did wear them. I’m furious over this for so many reasons:1. Completely inappropriate to yell at children like that. My kid cried the entire way home because she thought she was going to get kicked out of the dojo. 2. I believe in teaching my children to listen to their own bodies, not what other people say their bodies *should* feel. 3.

They said they’re only going for a week and I can spend the rest of the break working instead. Usually I would agree but they’re not going far away and these exams are really important to me. My parents ended up saying I was ungrateful as they were offering me a vacation which a lot of people don’t have the opportunity to do. As grateful as I am for the offer, we’ve been on vacations in the past and I’ve loved them but my exams are more important to me. They said they also didn’t trust me to be alone in the house for a week, so if I didn’t join them, they (my mum, dad, and two siblings) would be denied a vacation that they want.I understand their concern but I’m capable of looking after myself for a week and the quiet would actually help my studying (there’s usually four other people in the house).I don’t think I’m being selfish or ungrateful but I don’t know.AITA?Edit for INFO: 17(F), they don’t trust me alone for the week as they’re worried I’ll host a party and cause damage as I attend quite a few, but I’ve never had one at my house and never gone behind their back either. I live in the UK so we have a 2 week break in April right before exams start. I’m a major procrastinator and the only way I’ve found that is best for me to study is at home in a particular set up, as well as all of my textbooks etc being too heavy to be able to bring on the flight without paying extra.",AITA For refusing to go on vacation with my family during exam time?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uiqsa/aita_for_refusing_to_go_on_vacation_with_my/

As a grown adult with my own responsibilities and things I would like to do on the weekends. I was not home since Friday after I got off work. I was 7 hours away. My plan was not to be home at least until 5 or 6pm in the evening. I had replied to it with a lengthy message about the only time I do get to myself is on the weekends to do anything because work has me on 12 hours, 5 days a week. I wanted to take a weekend to myself and don't have any real reason to tell anyone what I am doing because that's what you can do as an adult. My youngest brother has had a place to always live, handouts - like my mom giving him whatever he wants to eat or drink while also paying for only his phone bill, xbox platinum and the cigarettes he smokes (and i question if he is actually buying them). Regardless, I shouldn't have to do my grown adult brother's laundry like he is a kid. I believe if you are an adult, you should be taking care of your own responsibilities.

10taopr,388,"Backstory:My parents got divorced when I was around 11. Around the same time my mom was in a car accident and had won a fairly large settlement on top of my grandpa passing away right in the middle of it. So she was left with a fairly large chunk of money.During their divorce, my mom constantly kept me and my siblings in the loop of everything and made my dad look like the villain in the situation despite my mom cheating being the reason for the separation. And when you’re young, you want to believe your parents have your best interests in heart. My dad paid over $300 weekly in child support for my siblings and I, and when I decided at 20 I wanted to move in with my dad she stopped talking to me for a while since she would fully lose all child support.Part of the divorce agreement was that my dad would not ask for any of the money from the settlement as long as $40,000 of it went into a college fund for me, since at the time my siblings had no interest to pursue college. Everything was arranged, the divorce papers were signed, and my mom gloated about how much money I would have for school. And on top of that my siblings and I had $10,000 each as an inheritance from my grandfathers will for us to use when we turned 18.A few years later she had fully renovated my grandfathers house that we moved into, we had a new car, went on a 7 night Disney cruise followed by a stay at a Deluxe Disney hotel. We were fairly happy, and I was a sophomore in high school excited to start looking at colleges, when my mom informed me she spent my entire college fund and inheritance on everything above.I. Was. Floored.The first thing I had done was tell my dad, who became so angry he immediately contacted his own lawyer and take my mom back to court to figure out a way to make that money back. At this point, we lived paycheck to paycheck and heavily relied on the child support to afford living.So she was served the court papers and they went in front of a judge, where my mom was given a slap on the wrist since it was determined she didn’t make enough money to pay back the $40,000 college fund.Throughout my entire childhood my mom was emotionally abusive towards me and my siblings. She manipulated us to be at each other’s throats constantly and was very narcissistic. She continued to get worse during my childhood and my anxiety and depression was crippling. It took moving to a different state to realize how harmful she was in my childhood and to see clearly how much she messed me up, and I went no contact almost a year ago.My dad is about to retire and made it known to me that according to his divorce agreement my mom gets a good chunk of his pension, which got my gears turning.Would I be able to take my mom to court over the college fund again, but this time to try to use his pension to replenish my funds?

I worked very hard to get where I am now, and I'm very proud of myself to be honest.My boyfriend of 3 years (I'll name him James - 28M) is my boss' ( Let's call her Nora - 36F) cousin (he has a completely different line of work). I haven't seen Nora outside of work much (Even at work, I don't see her a lot because she is at the very top of the hierarchy and I don't have a lot of work that directly needs her attention - but everyone agrees that she is an awesome boss). That changed when James' uncle (Nora's dad) invited the whole family including James and I over to his house for dinner. Notably, James doesn't like Nora for reasons I don't understand.Obviously, Nora, her wife and kids were there as well. She didn't make a big deal out of being my boss and I felt super comfortable in the family environment. Everyone was initially very sweet. Over dinner, James' dad asked me how hard Nora was on us at the company. He said he'd heard about how she made everyone work overtime and was horrible to be around.Nora is exactly the opposite of that. I don't have a lot of experience but she is the kindest, most inspiring boss one could wish for. She works double all of her employees and never makes anyone feel like they're being taken advantage of. She appreciates everyone's efforts and that's why everyone at work is actually happy to work overtime and help her with stuff. I told James' dad exactly all this. He didn't like the answer but I could tell Nora and her wife were loving it. And I added that despite not having a lot of experience, I was more than happy to work in the same company as Nora did. The conversation ended there. I thought that was the end of the story.On the way back, James asked me what the actual F was going on because I totally humiliated his dad in front of the whole family. He said his dad liked teasing Nora and it wasn't personal and I should have just avoided the question and ignored that.I said I honestly don't get how I humiliated him. James hasn't talked to me ever since and thinks I owe his dad an apology. I asked me colleagues and they all agrees that it was absolutely ridiculous to criticise Nora as a boss like that in the first place.

My one of my hall mates was trying to get the same single room I was gunning for (we have had legitimate reasons and unfortunately we're both unsuccessful). As we were both checking out the room I casually asked him why he wanted it and he legit told me with a straight face that his friends kept kicking him out of his room to have orgies. I laughed. I couldn't help myself and to be honest I didn't even think he was being serious but then I could see on his face that he was upset and he left the room almost immediately. About 10 minutes later I go up to his room to apologise and he said that he wouldn't forgive me and that i was being insensitive by laughing. I told him he didn't have to forgive me and that i once again apologised for what i did, that i never meant to be insensitive and I was sorry for upsetting him. he then said that i was an awful person and this was the reason i had no friends. this stung a bit but i just told him that i have said what i have come here to say and proceeded to walk away. he then steps out of the room and shouts at me down the corridor saying all kinds of things about me. i don't even say anything. I was too bewildered. With these three posts I made tonight, i understand that I might have very well been an AH in each one but with this one I genuinely believe I rectified it in the best way I could and there was no one around for either conversation (although anyone in their rooms could have heard the shouting) so it's not like i caused him to embarrass himself or anything.

It just so happened that a friend of a friend had puppies otw so I decided to get one (husky to be exact).However I knew this would impose problems with my trip so I asked my mom if it was okay. I had only paid a deposit at the time and if she was against the idea of it I would regain my deposit and wait until I moved out to get a dog.She said it was fine and that she would be more than happy to watch over my puppy for me while I was away.Two days after putting a deposit, she tells me that she wanted to get a puppy too from the same exact litter… I was like okay? but it’s gonna A LOT of work but she seemed adamant on getting it regardless.This bothered me because I felt like she was just copying me, which she does for literally everything I do. I buy a house she wants to buy a house, I go back to school in computer science and she applies to school for computer science, I get a puppy… well you know the rest.Fast forward to my return from my trip and I feel like although she did take care of him, she kind of also neglected him in a way. She also boasts about what her dog can do and I find it confusing because now her dog seems really well trained while my pup is way behind compared to his brother. I know it was a lot of work but still I can’t help but feel like my dog was caged up for most of the time that I was gone.She says that he’s behind because I trained him differently than she did before I left but honestly he was very obedient before I left.Also the cage was left in our basement where it’s VERY cold sometimes and it goes in the negative Celsius because of the poor isolation. The other dogs cage is upstairs where it’s nice and warm and right beside her room.I wasn’t expecting my mom to literally train my dog for me at all, it’s more of the neglect that’s bothering me. I know she was doing me a favour but honestly I can’t help but feel frustrated.I expressed my frustration and now she’s giving me the cold shoulder.

He tried to argue it has not been until I pointed out a storage container that had remains from something I made almost two weeks prior. Annoyed, he said that there wouldn't be so many dirty dishes if I didn't stick the leftovers in those containers and since I put them in those containers initially they're ""my"" dishes to wash because he never puts them in those. Note that in almost ten years together, I can count on both hands the amount of times he's actually cooked food.Something finally came undone in me and instead of getting angry I looked at him and said going forward there will be no issues with him and these dishes from him eating leftovers. He asked what I meant by that and I said going forward when we go for groceries I will focus on my groceries to make my own meals and he can focus on his. He laughed it off thinking I was joking.Later on at the store, I went out of my way to buy things that I knew he would not eat due to his very picky eating habits (No red meat, no fish,  no dairy except some type of cheese that I do not care for, etc). Instead of getting chicken, I got steak. Instead of ground turkey, I got ground beef. For the stir fry I usually make, I got beef broth to flavor it with.He noticed immediately at the start of the trip when I grabbed the ground beef and he made a comment that I grabbed the wrong pack.

I went on to marry the said girlfriend (36F- she's now my wife of 11 years - and we have 3 kids) and eventually lost contact with my mom. My relationship with my siblings was better initially (I have 2 brothers and 2 sisters, all of them older). Now I married into a very comfortable family. I would help my siblings financially, emotionally and in any way I could. I later realized that they were exploiting me for monetary reasons and stopped that but didn't lose contact with them, only for the sake of being there for my nieces and nephews.My mother passed away earlier this year at the age of 67. She had many health issues. Her lawyer contacted me to let me know she had left me a part of her belongings and some assets. I don't come from an exceptionally wealthy family but my mom was not poor at all.Considering the relationship I had with my mom, I didn't feel comfortable taking the inheritance. I asked my wife and she said it was sweet of my mom to show this act of kindness even with the relationship we had and suggested maybe I could donate it to a charity doing research or providing health services for breast cancer patients in my mom's name (which is the disease my mom died from). I loved the idea and went on to officially do that.My siblings were outraged once they found out. My mother left them all assets (though a bit less than mine). They were very angry that while this money won't make much of a difference to me, it is something that could change their lives and they needed it much more than some charity.My nephews have even reached out to called me a selfish AH because their parents were hoping to send him and his siblings to college with the said money and now couldn't.

10ug2wh,9,"Today my best friend got mad at me for not asking if she was okay after she fell down the stairs. She texted that she fell down the stairs in a groupchat and I clicked on the chat but didn’t read it, because I had a guest over and I was concentrated on them. Later in PM’s when I told her about something exciting happening to me soon, she said that she wanted a change of subject and began telling me about how I was a bad friend for not asking her how she was doing after the fall. I was confused and looked in the GC to find what she was talking about. She was mad that the other friend in the GC had asked if she was okay, but her supposed best friend (aka me) didn’t ask. I asked her that since the other friend had already asked if she was okay and she answered yes, should I have then asked for a second time if she was ok? She said that I should at least react and when she has had something happen before then I haven’t asked either if she was ok. I lashed out and said that her and my phone aren’t the only things that I have in my life. She said she understood but thought that for example a complete stranger would’ve been more concerned than me if she was in the ER. I told her that my doctor suspects autism and some people on the spectrum may have problems with empathy and if I saw her say that she was ok, then usually I don’t care any further. She named 3 situations where I didn’t ask her how she was doing, for example when her cat was dying, I asked how her cat was doing but not how she herself was doing. I told her I thought the cat situation was obviously hard for her and there was no need to ask. She asked to stop and end the conversation because it was going nowhere. It confuses me because I remember a lot of times where I have asked if she was doing alright and when she’s going through a rough patch I try my best to ask it frequently (even if I don’t care that much) because I know it’s important to them. I usually don’t ask anyone if they are ok, when it’s obvious they are not ok (I’ll still try my best to be supportive in other ways) or they have followed up with saying that they are ok. AITA here?

10twne2,32,"I come from a developing country where women should cook, raise kids, and essentially do the domestic tasks. My parents raised me that way but I never believed it.  We were taught that men bring home the paycheck and women take care of the house. It's literally in our books for the 1st to 3rd grade (padre de pamilya/head of the family/Ikaw Ng tahanan/light for the house).Except I made 5 times my husband and in the last decade or so half of the women in my country started working. So both now bring home the paycheck.  Our country is the 4th country over all with more women in managerial positions than anywhere else at 59.36% but our belief system does not change that women should still carry both burden of house work and finances. I can proudly say I can hire someone to clean and cook for us the rest of the house chores and child raising are divided between me and my husband equally and our kids also have their own chores. I raised my daughters to look for a partner and not a husband. I raise them by giving them flowers, chocolates and presents that way if a guy ever ""courts"" them they are not blinded by material things and see a man for what he is.My daughter (16) has recently brought home a boy and is essentially, I know this makes me horrible to say but not ""house trained"". Leaves the dishes out for someone to clean after him, leaves his shoes on the floor. Leaves his messes lying around. Whenever he comes over I remind him of the rules of the house and recently asked him a couple of questions such as does he know how to do the laundry, does he know how to sweep the floors, does he know, how to clean or even cook. He said no to all this. His mother and sisters do this for him. I'm a firm believer that any boy that my daughter brings home to is a potential husband and has a potential to marry and be part of our family as such I want to ensure my future SIL is looking for a partner and not a maid, laundry lady, baby maker, nanny etc.On one particular Saturday I had my daughter and her boyfriend cook (our cook was on her day off). I supervised both of them, my daughter knew how to prepare the meat, cut, saute, boil, season etc and he was just mostly there handing her things. It took less than 20 minutes. We ate as normal, talked during the meal and nothing else.Later on I get a message request from my facebook account from his mother. I asked her what was wrong with that and she said I had the audacity to treat him like the help when he is treated as a prince in their house.... She said  a couple of other things but what struck me is her main objection was that her son was a guest in my house and shouldn't have cooked and he was taught to cook specifically as she was my daughter's boyfriend. 1) I think I may be the A because I gave cooking lessons without consent to a guest? 2) I don't think I'm the A because it didn't hurt my daughter's boyfriend by learning a life skill.",AITA for teaching a guest how to cook?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10twne2/aita_for_teaching_a_guest_how_to_cook/

Not to say I’m like super amazing at everything academic, but I still do well. I try to make her feel proud when she does get good grades, convince her good grades aren’t everything, and help her with her subjects, but my parents have put a lot of emphasis over our grades in the past. That sort of pressure doesn’t go away easily; I know she’s insecure about it.She has always been way more immature than she should. She takes her anger out on our whole family. She’s almost 13 and she still has tantrums. For reference, I’m not an adult, but I am an older teenager. I try to be patient with her; my brother and I tend to get the attention, and I know it takes a toll.Recently, I was trying to sleep on the couch. Unprovoked, she keeps banging a pillow on my face. This is not uncommon. She has done worse before. But I was getting annoyed with the constant harassment, especially when she had been a total jerk last night. So I started targeting some sore spots for her. “At least I’m not in remedial classes,” “I wasn’t in these classes at your age,” etc. I know it probably hurt her.

10u04bs,33,"So, my incredible wife Jenna, two weeks after having a C-section to deliver our son (our first child), had to have another surgery when her appendix almost ruptured. As stated by her doctor, Jenna needs to be doing more resting than mothering for the next few weeks.Before Jenna came home from the second time at the hospital last week, her sister, Kelly, offered to come into town for two weeks and help us around the house while Jenna recovered, as she was between jobs and her husband didn't mind. (Note: Jenna is the youngest of 4 siblings and Kelly is the eldest, and while the two were close at one point they grew apart when Jenna moved).This worked out because I would be able to work at my part time gig/ do other chores without leaving Jenna alone. We agreed, and the first couple of days were fine, Kelly helped with a lot of the housework with no signs of trouble between them. But last night when I got home Jenna said that Kelly had been bothering her whenever I wasn't around about being more active and being critical of Jenna's food choices (ex: telling Jenna to not be lazy and get up for \_\_\_\_, and then later asking her if she really needed to eat ice cream). This boiled to a head when Kelly told Jenna something along the lines of ""You are going to end up a single mother because you let yourself go"" because she didn’t want to go on a walk with Kelly.This comment made Jenna upset because it was an awful thing to say, also because she has an anxiety and eating disorder... So, it made her feel super shitty for no reason. I asked Jenna if she wanted me to talk to Kelly for her, to which she said she didn’t care.I wasn't planning to confront Kelly but while Jenna was sleeping, Kelly asked me if she was still sulking. I said no, but that she was really upset. Kelly said she was only looking out for Jenna's health so that she can recover from the surgeries faster. When I mentioned the ""single mother"" comment she laughed, said it was a joke and called Jenna overly sensitive and hormonal for being mad about that. She showed no remorse.My exact response was ""You should really leave tomorrow"" I didn't say anything else; I didn't walk up to Kelly; I didn't even look at her. She asked me if I was threatening her, to which I said that I wasn’t but that her help isn’t worth making Jenna feel worse while already she’s vulnerable.Kelly ended up leaving today after telling Jenna that I'm manipulating her and not to trust me, that she's sorry about what she said but it was just a joke. She also reached out to their family and told them that I threatened her over a joke and manipulated Jenna, she also said that we were both incredibly rude and ungrateful.

10uy1dm,36,"My grandma has 6 dogs. Not one of the dogs is trained in any way. They all poop/pee in the house. My grandma is generally a clean person except for one thing. When the dogs go on the floor, she just picks up the poop/pee. She doesn't deep clean where the feces was. Maybe she does it after I leave, but based on how nonchalant she is about it, i don't think so. I have a dog at my own house, and if there is an accident, i really scrub the area thoroughly.I am watching these dogs for the next two weeks. On the very first day i got here, there were 3 piles of poop and wiped 4 piles of pee. The free roaming dogs had peed on the caged one.The dogs have to be closely monitored while outside otherwise they won't go. I also have to follow them with poop scoopers because they all eat poop if i am not quick enough. Then they jump all over me and lick me with their poopy mouths. One of them managed to sneak a frozen turd that i missed inside and crunched on it like a nice crispy treat. I chased her around, but i couldn't get it in time. she ate the whole thing. Then, when i went to bed, she puked up the entire turd on me, intact. The last time i watched them, one of them peed on me in the middle of the night.I never get more than 3 hours of sleep at a time  because they wake me up to let them out, usually 3 times a night and they still poop everywhere. During the day they are let out every 1.5 hours and they still poo inside. I can't leave the house for more than 4 hours at a time, or i return to a literal shit show. Luckily, i do a hybrid work from home job so its not a huge issue. I only get paid $20 a day to watch these dogs. Someone told me that my grandma would be paying over $1000 for a professional sitter and i should charge way more. If i charged how much it would take me to watch these dogs for a stranger, there is no amount of money. I wouldn't do it. I only do it to help my grandma.  She can't afford to pay more.I was telling my sister about this and she said i must spend hours cleaning everyday. i told her that i didn't clean up at all besides to pick the poop off the ground and leave shoes on at all times. I explained that our grandma didn't do more than that. The dogs poop constantly, and one licks the entire couch after eating poop. Several of the dogs are wrinkly breeds like char pei and bull dogs and need their wrinkles cleaned, but it has never been done, saying they dont need it. So they always smell. One of them is always wiping snot on everything. I don't mean a little, i mean, i got slimed like i was in ghost busters and had to change my pants. My sister said i was an asshole to not clean throughly and i kind of agree that i shoudl clean better, its how i would want my house to be treated but i don't see a point with how gross all these dogs are and the fact that my grandma does the same level of cleaning.Update: i posted this then went to bed.

To this she told me that she knew I was coming and to wait there.After this my best friend walked of and I sat on a chair that was close to there.When she got back she walked past me like I wasn't there into her Cabinet so I decided to wait a little more.After like 10-15 minutes I got up and knocked because the break was about to end. Another teacher opened the door and pointed to a sign 'if the door is open after knocking go in'. I nodded to the teacher to greet him and also like I understand.

We feel like in a way vaping is worse than smoke cigs because you can sit inside all day and vape. Jay and I don’t smoke cigarettes in the house so we smoke outside and not as often as vaping. Anyways, tonight my boyfriend got home from a day trip and I went to smoke a cig. My pack of cigarettes are about half full. Jay and I got cigarettes the same day about 4 days ago. His pack is empty. Jay asked me for a cigarette and i said,“Maybe, you shouldn’t smoke so much.”His reply,“Well, I have to smoke more because I’m bigger.”I thought that was one of the stupidest things I’ve heard. I don’t think weight plays into how much you smoke. I said,“That doesn’t make sense. It’s a choice how much you smoke.”He said,“It’s like medicine. You smoke according to your body weight and how much you need.”This annoyed me because I take medicine for my borderline personality disorder and I don’t think you can compare cigarettes to medicine.I said,“You can’t compare it to medicine. Medicine usually helps you. Cigarettes don’t. All it is is just an addiction to nicotine.”Jay said,“Well people get addicted to pain killers and they need to take them.”At this point i’m irritated. He’s begging me to smoke.I said“Yeah people get addicted to pain killers, but you don’t need to take them. It’s just an addiction. You can either decide to smoke all of them or go without and you should go without”During this conversation i was smoking a cigarette. Jay said,“Then you should go without too.

10toc16,105,"My (30M) fiancé (let's call him Wade, fake name) proposed to me (27F) two years ago using a family heirloom ring from my family. For more detail, it belonged to my maternal grandmother and when she passed, my mum inherited it. It has always been a fact that she will give it to one of her daughters when we grow up. We also always assumed she will give it to my sister Mercy (28F). To be clear, it's not a super expensive ring or anything. Mum added a diamond to it but it costs around the same as the average engagement ring. This might be important to the story: Mercy is my half sister, same dad different mums. Her bio mum has never been in the picture but my mum has always made it clear we are both her daughters and she loves us both. She has also always treated Mercy well.Anyway when mum gave the ring to my now fiancé to propose to me, I was pleasantly surprised but also confused. But again, mum never said who she would give the ring to. Later I talked to mum about the ring and found out mum only gave my fiancé the ring because Mercy didn't think she would ever get married.I talked to Mercy later and she confirmed this. She felt strongly against marriage and with good cause which isn't relevant here.The issue now is that Mercy has been dating this nice guy let's call him Jake (35F). He is sweet, treats her like a queen and has a cute son. He has been putting it out there that he intends to propose and even asked for our parents' blessing. Now Mercy wants the ring back.My fiancé and I didn't have any problem giving it back right after our engagement and finding another one but it has come to mean so much to us. We have been planning our wedding with my late grandma in mind and grandma only had one ring, my current engagement ring, and it's like the final touch. Other details include remaking her wedding dress, using one of her necklaces, getting a wedding band that's a perfect match to pair with the engagement ring, etc. I told Mercy this and she said we can just design a ring that looks the same. One of her reasons is 'she isn't our mum's biological daughter so she should get this one privilege.

10u8q9f,23,"My mom bought me some ice cream because I bought her flowers, and she had been seeing how stressed I was lately. My mom, her boyfriend, my brother and I were sitting and eating at the table. My mom had asked before dinner that she wanted to try some ice cream, so after dinner I put ice cream in a bowl for her and left the kitchen with some in a bowl for me as well. A few minutes later my mom comes into the room and asks me why I didn't put any ice cream for her boyfriend. I said that he didn't ask for any so I thought he didn't want any. My mom goes back in the kitchen and her boyfriend comes into the room and tells me that the ice cream is in the trash outside if I wanted it, then he goes upstairs and comes back minutes later telling me to get off of the couch because I was watching Netflix in front of the tv and that he was sick of having to go upstairs to his room to watch tv there. So I left into the kitchen and balled up on the floor. Then I heard my mom and him fighting. He called me some kind of princess and how the world revolved around me, and then he started talking about this little fight I had with my teen brother after dinner. He checked the freezer and I tried to stop him as like a joke, and he found the ice cream. I told him not to eat it all because my brother is a huge guy and he eats a lot. Huge not meaning plus size, huge meaning 7 foot tall buff high schooler. My brother got all angry and said he didn't want ice cream anymore as a joke, but I kept trying to give it to him. My brother asked what the flavours were and was disgusted anyway and said that he really didn't like those flavours. So anyway my mom's boyfriend goes on about how his kids don't ever fight like that and I'm a savage for not giving him ice cream, even though my brother said he hated those flavours anyway.Also I have ADHD and maybe I missed some kind of signal from my mom's boyfriend that maybe he wanted ice cream?I feel really guilty.

My dad and I were her primary caregivers throughout her final weeks of life as she wanted to pass at home. One day as I was sitting with my grandmother she gave me her wedding and engagement rings as a 19th birthday present. I was completely shocked but flattered to be gifted these rings. But, this gift upset my entire family as I was not the next in line to receive them. Shortly after her death, my grandfather received my grandmothers life insurance check. While eating dinner with my grandfather, he told me he has decided to use my grandmothers life insurance check to pay for my tuition and housing at college because that is what my grandmother would have wanted. My aunt (dads sister) is helping my grandfather manage all of his finances now that my grandmother has passed. When my grandfather told my aunt about his plans for the money, she was furious.

My hand has now gotten better and i started packing my art supplies when i noticed that most of my paint has been ruined. Let me mention that as an artist I hate when things aren't perfect and love my art supplies more than anything. Anyways when i opened the bag with paint i noticed that half of the tubes weren't closed so they dried out and the other half was completely empty. I thought that it was only the smaller tubes of paint but then i noticed the acrylics that my parents bought me for Christmas were ruined as well. The caps were covered with paint and the tubes were almost impossible to clean. I had told them millions of times to leave the tubes clean and close them. I had also said that they weren't allowed to touch my new special acrylics since they were a gift from my parents.

10uf9e9,20,"My (44f) parents live with me in my home for several various reasons. Since they have moved in there have been several issues. My mom tries to boss me around like I’m a kid living in HER house. Sometimes she yells at me too. If she cooks dinner and I eat her food she has me clean the kitchen. Fair enough. However I have Crohn’s disease (as does my mother) and right after eating my stomach hurts. So I’ve asked her to give me 30-60 minutes for my stomach to settle before I get to work on the kitchen. This is unacceptable to her for some reason and she starts yelling at me to do it immediately. A little back story- when I grew up she barely cleaned. Our house was borderline hoarderish. So it makes no sense to me. My mom is in a bad mood a LOT. I’m pretty sure a lot of it stems from the fact that my step dad does not help her out with housework at all, save the occasional dishes and taking out the trash. She’s always grumpy rarely happy. She is very critical of everyone including my daughter and I.  So yesterday I had a long talk with her. I came to her very respectfully, I didn’t raise my voice or anything. I nicely asked her to not yell at me, and to stop slamming things around when she has her little outbursts. She got really angry, denying she does those things. She also basically said I’m 71 I’ll say whatever I want whenever to whomever I want. I said that’s her prerogative but she’s going to push people away. Which she had to some extent especially with my daughter. I told my mom if she wants to have a better relationship with my daughter she needs to be more positive, and happy when my daughter is around instead of so critical. I told her if she does that my daughter will come around just give her time. She’s says I’m 71 I don’t have time to wait. I said well you’re going to reap what you sow if you continue to be so negative all the time. She got really pissed. She says that by asking her to not speak her mind I’m invalidating her. One more thing we talked about- starting from when I was little my stepdad called my sister and I awful names. He liked to embarrass us when people would come over he would tell people how we were bad kids etc. it really took a toll on me mentally. He still does it sometimes. He tells people we were awful kids and thinks it’s funny. He also says things like I’d look a lot better if I lost some weight (I’m 135) and says I need Botox. It’s very hurtful. I asked my mom yesterday why she had never stood up for me. She basically said she did but I wasn’t around to hear it. Part of me doesn’t believe her. Mainly because of recent incidents where she has just say there shrugging her shoulders over the Botox and weight loss comments. It’s hurtful and frustrating. Lots are supposed to stick up for their kids.I’m frustrated and hurt all around. AITA for saying these things? She won’t even talk to me this morning.ETA- if I kicked them out they would have no place to go and might be homeless.

Then she made another request, she wanted to sit in the front, which was something I didn't want. Once a week I get to go for a drive to look at the sunrise and feel calmer and it seemed like she wanted to take that away from me, sitting at the back  isn't the same. I told her no and if she wanted to come she should sit in the back. My mum thought this wasn't acceptable and it ended in a fight. I know I sound stupid and immature but this is something that brings me joy and she wants to take that away from me. I just wish she could find something else to do with my dad and I such as going for a walk or riding a bike. I need to know if I'm TA for this.",AITA for not wanting my sister to ride in the front seat?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ua3po/aita_for_not_wanting_my_sister_to_ride_in_the/

I think there might be more but i dont want to self diagnose myselfTo graduate i have to do an internship, which means one week im at school and the other im working FULLTIME + learning. School alone was difficult enough and robbed all my energy but now....I come home and sleep. I dont even exaggerate, i just sleep till i wake up at 5am again. I have the feeling i might suffer under burn out. I already have panick attacks because i cant get my stuff done.The weekends are the only time in the week were  can relax a little bit. Not even fully relax because i worry all the time about stuff i havent finished but i also dont feel able to finish the stuff.There have been a lot of fights about household chores.  I have one older sister who is 18 and a smaller one who is 13 and gets a whole different treatment then me with 13. I did grocery shopping (without car or bike), made laundry, the whole kitchen often etc. But if my sister needs to wash the dishes it would be cruel🙄I also have a step father and my mother who is a stay at home mother. I help in the school weeks but i just dont have the energy to help after coming home from work and i want to use the weekends to relax and get other stuff done (like my room or homework). I always get screamed at for being lazy and just bratty. My mother often doesnt cook for me anymore because i dont help as much anymore (i just eat cornflakes or something that is fast). She talks bad about me with my little sister like that im disgusting and i schould just live in my hole etc...My mother knows at least about my strong depressions and adhd. I dont think she is taking my adhd serious to be fair because im ""just lazy"". The whole family knows still im TA. Thats why im asking the question because my whole family is against me.

I'm completely self reliant financially (as I live alone, I'm not married, and our parents are very poor so I'm always trying to save a good savings pot). My brother didn't work much at all when at uni for 3 yrs, then had 1 year of doing fairly minor jobs during the pandemic and then went to do a 2nd degree at uni for 2yrs whilst working a little bit part time. He has much less money than I do (but is also not a good saver and will spend on himself and others very easily, especially on stuff that isn't an essential e.g. apple smart watches for himself, my mum and my dad despite none of them doing any exercise and my parents not being into wearable tech at all (this was at the point when he already had zero savings). I've also loaned him money in the past for his rent / laptop etc (not often though).At christmas this year, I asked him what he wanted and he specified 3 items that altogether came to £43 (and no way to get those things cheaper). He didn't ask me what I wanted and sent me £13 gift card for christmas. I found it a bit odd that he'd requested stuff that costs x3 more than what he was planning to give me. Of course the value of presents do not need to match precisely but I don't think I'd ever ask someone for stuff x3 as expensive as what I could/would give them. I don't know if perhaps he has an expectation that as I'm the ""big sister"" and earn fairly well, this is the way it should be? I've no bitterness at all that he ""only gave me £13"" but it's more the whole dynamic of expecting more that I found a bit odd but maybe I'm just not viewing it right?He has been fairly generous in past years with presents. Recently, we don't have a good relationship as he's been siding with my mum who's a martyr narc on absolutely everything so I was not feeling particularly generous at all but gave £25.AITA?

10uoxq7,19,"My girlfriend and I (24f, 27m) have been dating for over a year and I love her to death. She's great and I really couldn't be happier. She has some mental struggles so our relationship isn't always perfectly stable but I feel like I do a decent enough job handling it and she does a great job trying to get help and lessening their impact on her and us. However this topic in particular has always been a source of negativity for her and has had such a bad impact on her mental health.We met through a mutual group of friends but I've since stopped talking to them. I eventually realized they weren't all that great of people, and the final straw in just removing them from my life was in seeing how they treat my girlfriend. They harass her, make fun of her, berate her, tell her to do harmful things to herself, even taunt her by showing her her own nudes (she dated one of the guys in this group beforehand). It's really disgusting and though I've told them to stop many times they don't care.Every week or two something with them will happen, and I'll end up having to console my girlfriend because she gets sad and upset and wonders what she's doing to deserve this. And every time, I tell her she needs to cut them out of her life and stop hanging out with them. She doesn't see this as an option. I tell her that when she goes back to school in the fall, or when she gets a job, she can try and meet new people and make new friends, or even hang out with my friends more often, but she's not having it. So I just drop it and calm her down until it inevitably happens again, and rinse and repeat.Well, the last time this happened, they did something particularly bad, and my girlfriend was extremely depressed and upset. I ended up having to leave work early just to go to her house and be there with her. Once things settled, I brought it up once again, and surprisingly she agreed. She went over the people she knew and who she'd keep in her life, and then blocked the numbers/social media accounts of the others. And that was that, at least I thought.A couple weeks went by and everything was fine, she said she felt a bit lonely but felt much happier and lighter now that she wasn't constantly berated, so I figured things were alright. But recently I saw an instagram story of her hanging out with them at a restaurant on that day, and I got really confused. I confronted her and she got really defensive and said she could do what she wants with her life, and when I pushed back, she got really pissed off and said I need to stop controlling her. It's been a couple of days since and she hasn't responded to any of my texts, so now I'm both getting worried and pissed off.

The night before my 15th birthday, I made it clear that I didn’t want my sister’s boyfriend to be at the celebratory dinner because he has repeatedly caused arguments between siblings and in the past, eaten snacks that I paid for myself with my allowance and unnecessarily involved himself in my business. When I stated this, my sister got angry and said ‘He’s my boyfriend and you’re being petty, you’d think because you’re older that you’d let things go but clearly not. I don’t know why we are celebrating a brat like you.’ In response, I brought up everything he had done to me prior and pointed out that he already gets enough food from me and said ‘He steals the snacks I paid for so he can survive not going to my dinner.’ Because of this, my sister called me ‘fat’ and ‘greedy’.

I went into town with my cousin for two hours and when I returned, I found she completely disregarded my wishes and took the cake to make her trifle anyway.

I accepted it, I didn’t care and I already hated my home life so it was another reason to gtfo. Flash forward to 2020 and all of a sudden…she wants to give me it. She gives this whole speech on how I should always have a “way out” and that this is an option for me (at the time implying that if the world is falling apart- surely so would my relationship or home life within it). I accepted it regardless because it would’ve been a fun project and I don’t have automotive skills so what a great place to start. One problem though. She refused to give me any paperwork regarding ownership or anything and insisted that she had it and will provide me it. Over time, it’s like she purposefully forgot and would accuse me of doing the transfer of title incorrectly. I wasn’t doing it incorrectly, I had several other people in my life (one who works in automotive industry and one who excels in administration duties) help me with this. This involves it being registered in another state with an address I do not know, it was a shit show. In early 2022 we finally get news that the out of state DMV office is more than happy to cooperate and get this title transfer expedited. I relay this to my grandmother after almost a year of no speaking (leaving out alot of context of her sending me rude messages on holidays). And she absolutely implodes. She proceeds to contact my partners parents (his mother being one person who’s helped me) and essentially drags my name through the mud. Bringing up unrelated incidents, accusing me of lying, calls me every name in the book. And she threatened to take the van back. So we said by all means, please take it because we are done with this headache. The person she sent to get it was drunk, aggressive towards me, and almost broke not only the U-Haul they rented to tow it but almost sent the van rolling into our home.

We got married early 2022 and are waiting for immigration to approve a green card for him. But in the meanwhile we are living separately which as you can imagine creates conflict especially when it’s been so long. And we’ve been relatively good at resolving conflict.But, three months ago he developed anxiety (has had two pretty bad anxiety attacks). Since then, there are certain topics that can’t be talked about, largely anything that is negative. That’s fine. But sometime this means he talks about his issues but treats mine like they’re dumb. Yesterday, I’d just gotten off work and was driving home. He was talking about his job and how he’s stressed with it. His job pays him very little so I said he should consider looking into another Job which he was very against. I then said if it was stressful and not paying much he could also cut back on some hours, etc.. it’s a lot more complex than that and the convo was longer but anyways, maybe my tips weren’t the best.But he tells me throughout the conversation that I’ve never had anxiety, that I don’t know what its like to work, what it’s like to have to build up your resume and said some things that made me feel like he thought I knew nothing. I’ve actually had many things happen in my life and have been living alone since 16… which he knows. I got mad at him and we got into a big fight.

I got there and we were getting ready to eat first, I talked to my sister and said hi to the birthday boy, Miles. While we were sitting down and ordering food, I noticed that my 13 y/o nephew, Kason, was not there. I asked my sister about it and she said it was no big deal, which was odd to me.I went to the bathroom and called Kason to see if everything was ok, he told me he was fine and then told me why he was skipping his younger brother’s party, apparently a few days ago, my sister got a call Miles and some other kids were bullying a boy at school. Apparently they were bullying the boy for being too “feminine” because he does ballet, and making homophobic remarks to him. The boy is one of Kason’s baseball teammates younger brother. Kason’s teammates convinced him not to go to his “toxic” brother’s party, and Kason told me he agreed with them. I could hear Kason get pretty angry in his tone when talking about Miles’s actions which is not normal for him, because it takes a lot to get him angry. After the phone call, I sat in the bathroom for a few minutes and was thinking to myself. Out of my 4 nieces and nephews, Kason is the only one who hasn’t got in trouble for bullying before. My sister and her husband dated in high school and were also bullies, and while they’re great to their kids, they often do act like the stereotype of a “Karen”. Miles is easily one of the worst kids I’ve seen. I decided to leave early and told my sister the truth, that I spoke to Kason and thought Miles didn’t deserve gifts. My gift was still in the car, so my husband and I left. I called Kason again to check on him and he asked if we could take him to the antique store my husband/his uncle owns, as the boys wanted to surprise the ballet boy who was bullied to some gifts. My husband and I took them and gave them some ballet related stuff and a few other things they’d say he’d like. I dropped Kason off at home, and later that day I spoke to my sister. She told me she told Kason the night before to skip the party, thinking he was bluffing and was very upset when she found out he wasn’t. She was also upset I gave the boys stuff to give to Kason’s friend’s younger brother. It’s been about a week now and Kason and Miles haven’t spoken to each other.

Jay came out to me as non-binary a few months ago and since then I’ve been helping them express themself in any way possible; they chose a more gender-neutral name to go by, I let their teachers know about the name and pronoun change, we go on weekend shopping trips to find clothes they’re comfortable in, etc. Jay’s father and I have been divorced for years, and unfortunately he is extremely intolerant of the LGBTQ+ community and refuses to accept Jay’s identity. He has custody every weekend. Jay often cries before leaving for their dad’s house because he refuses to let them dress in anything he deems masculine, he makes it a point to call them by their deadname at every chance he gets, and constantly makes transphobic comments. It breaks my heart seeing my child come home depressed and suffering from dysphoria because of the things their father says.Since coming out, Jay's been begging to get a more androgynous haircut. They’ve never had hair shorter than below-shoulder length because their father refuses to let them cut it, but long hair is one of the biggest dysphoria triggers for them so I finally agreed to let them get a haircut a couple days ago. I took them to a salon and they got a mens’ wolf cut that looks amazing on them, and they've been euphoric over how androgynous it makes them look. The haircut gave them so much more confidence and comfort in their appearance.Jay’s father came to pick them up this morning and the second he saw their hair, he shouted “What the hell did you do?” I told him it’s Jay’s hair and therefore Jay gets to decide what to do with it, which sparked a huge argument between us. I said he had no right to tell our teenage child what to do with their own body, and he accused me of brainwashing our kid into thinking they're a boy. He said I was only doing this to drive a wedge between him and Jay. After he said that Jay jumped in to defend themself, telling him it was their decision to get a haircut, and their father yelled at them and called them the f-slur. Because of that, Jay refused to go with him and told him to f- off. Jay’s father ended up getting the police involved and they made Jay get in the car and go to his house as scheduled. Watching my child sob and beg me not to let him take them broke me and I’ve been crying ever since. Jay’s father texted me to say he’ll be speaking to his lawyer about getting full custody and told me that it's one thing to be delusional, but it's abusive for me to push my delusions onto Jay and I’m a danger to myself and my kid.Since they left, Jay’s been texting me saying they want to come home because their father keeps insulting their haircut and calling them transphobic slurs. I’m wondering if I made the wrong decision in letting Jay get a haircut, if all the trauma and verbal abuse they suffered was worth it.

I don't know her boyfriend's exact age.I was talking to my mom and her boyfriend about Netflix's new restrictions on password sharing, and how everyone was upset about it. They were both under the impression that this was a good business move. After talking for a while, I said that I had seen four videos, each with millions of likes, all saying that it was a terrible business move. He immediately started making fun of me for thinking four people leaving Netflix was going to affect them. He cut me off probably 10 times while I was trying to re-explain that each of these videos had millions of likes. He wouldn't let me get more than two words in. I began to feel very frustrated and felt that saying ""please don't cut me off,"" or ""let me talk"" would be to no avail as he would cut me off saying that sentence. So, I screamed ""LET ME TALK! LET ME TALK!"" Finally, I was allowed to speak. Later, when my mom and I were alone, she told me ""I get that he was being annoying, but you shouldn't have screamed at him."" She went on to talk about how I should have said ""Let me talk,"" before yelling it.Even later that night, I retold this story to my partner, and they told me that I was 100% in the right, so now I don't know what to think.TLDR; My mom's boyfriend cut me off probably 10 times, while making fun of me, and not letting me get more than two words in.

It is a very popular artist that many people will be traveling to see, including us who will be attending in a state we don't live in. I met these 5 attendees through a friend, so I don't know them all well, but we all decided to go together to split costs and enjoy a common favourite artist together.The concert is well over 5 months away, but we have started to look for accommodations and are seeing that all low-cost options have already been booked up. The cheapest option we found was a hostel style bunk bed hotel, that would be $50/night per person ($100 total per person for 2 nights). That place is completely booked for the exact dates we need. I looked on Airbnb and found an option that would put us at about $136 per person for the 2 nights. I messaged the group chat and asked everyone if that was an okay price, since the hostel is completely booked. One person responded saying that it's too expensive since the cost of the concert ticket itself was more than they anticipated. I asked what their budget was, but they didn't answer. I'm concerned that if we don't book a place soon, that we will be out of reasonable options and have to pay even more for somewhere to stay since the other places I saw were much more expensive. The Airbnb I found has a free cancellation policy up to one night before the reservation, so I'm tempted to book it, and sort out the cost later or even cancel it if it's really not viable for this person's budget. It seems like an asshole move because they already told me it's too much for them, but I'm worried that if we wait awhile longer that we won't even have that as an option and will have to pay more.

Yesterday, I attempted to wake him up 2-3 times, and each time he just told me he wanted to sleep.

This morning I got up and did my regular morning routine, thinking that if he wasn't awake by noon I'd actually make him get up. But at the same time, I'm focused on schoolwork. I heard him get up around 10:30, and went upstairs to ask if he wanted coffee and to say good morning.

I have been goi g to the gym and exercising very regularly for over 5 years, and also love investigating and reading about new research and staff like that in fitness. I joined this new CrossFit gym last year, and I had never done CrossFit before so it was new to me and also exciting. At the end of the first session which was basically a huge HIIT workout, instructor starts telling everyone how a lot of research shows how HIIT is superior to just normal cardio workout, and I said actually there had been a lot of new research showing that not to be true. It really rubbed me the wrong way they an instructor would give false information. He said nothing that day. Next day, on the session, one of the exercises they had, I knew would destroy my shoulder. I have had a motorcycle accident, and had a surgery on the shoulder, but unfortunately it has never healed completely so I have to be careful what I do, and am somewhat limited in some exercises. I mentioned this to the instructor, and also suggested another shoulder exercise for myself instead of the one they had, which works same muscle but does not put my shoulder into a compromised position. He did not even ask what kind of accident or surgery I had to asses my fitness to his exercise and was adamant I do the exercise he had on the list. I did not want to argue any more and did the exercise his way. I still made sure I was safe by taking much lower weights which basically would not compromise me. Here comes the 3rd day, I come in, and the instructor (who is also owner of the gym) tells me I have to leave, Tver I do not fit with this gym. The reasons cited were these two incidents. I agree I could have handled the first incident better and should not have corrected him in front of the class, and probably just should have told that to him in privets. But unfortunately that’s just how it happened, and I sometimes say things without thinking much in consequences and then I am sorry I say them.

Since she never wanted to lie she's always just been intentionally vague but that didn't hold and this time I guess the combination of persistence, wine, and feeling comfortable with her at this point (they've been friends a little over a year now) got her to let her guard down and she told her the truth, and her friend got upset and they said some things back and forth and her friend ended up leaving and they didn't talk for a few days. When they made up her friend upset her again by pushing an apology and attempt at reconciliation, pushing herself to help, which is not really up to Becca anyway but upset her to discuss. In the end they are ok, but her friend still brings it up occasionally and will say unkind things about me so I told Becca I don't want her at my party because she won't let it go and worse might even try something there.Now Becca is upset because they were planning it together and she is always at these things with us, but I don't trust her friend to not embarrass me or worse, and while I know I've done things I don't think it's relevant.

They became friends first and we both got introduced to one another through her. They were the irl friends but online me and him had begun getting closer as well. Him and her had some weird push and pull relationship where my exbff would push her friendship onto him when he clearly didn't want to be close, declaring herself his best friend when he already refused to the idea and they would constantly fight for petty reasons. Their friendship was toxic in general but there's too many details to explain.So, while we're hanging out one day she makes a very snarky remark and i was not in the mood to deal with that (it was the day before my grandfather's birthday who had passed not long ago) so i refused to talk to her the rest of the day in anger. she later called me crying and i apologized for my behaviour and explained my reasoning. i thought we sorted stuff out but oh boy it was a wishful thinking.After this she started behaving really weird with me and would make comments like ""why don't u two just hang out together, you're perfect for each other"" when me and him were talking and just generally upset about us getting closer.I've felt really guilty about doing what I did that day and have apologized several times to her and everytime, she reassured me before going back to acting weird. I even asked if she liked him just in case but she refused so i don't understand the problem. We're slowly ignoring each other but it's hard because we have the same friend group.Me and him both were dealing with some similar problems in life atm which just made him a trustable person to talk my problems with. We got closer overtime and exbff and him grew distant and he's told her he doesn't wanna be her bff. At this point me and her are not contacting each other at all because she thinks I've told him to break things off with her. So now my exbff is really rude to me and i feel helpless.

10u6uax,27,"Where I work when we have an in store purchase while working we are checked out by a manager and our items are placed in a clear bag and double knotted. (Loss prevention purposes) we keep our purchase items in that double knotted form and in sight in the breakroom until you leave for the day. My store was having a sale on chocolate bars and chocolate baking melts because they’re expiring in the next few weeks. Me and my coworker/best friend basically bought the same things because we both bake and are looking to make cake pops with the melts. The only thing differentiating our stuff was the candy bars we bought, she bought more than me. When we left for the day i get a text from her realizing we had accidentally grabbed each other bags. I’m like oops haha and leave her bag on the kitchen counter ready to just give her her whenever i see her next. Next day comes and I’m off so I call her when i got home and i realize oh i never got your candy bars. I go to open the bag and realize the bars are missing. I’m so confused because the bag was double knotted still as it was when my manager checked me out. I’m like no way and go to check in the trash if there’s any open candy bar wrappers and sure enough someone ate them. I’m pissed honestly a bit more than my friend is because someone really opened a double knotted bag ate the candy and re double tied it. I leave this note on the corner of the table so everyone can see it. Here’s a visual…Contents of letter taped to empty chocolate wrappers: “To whoever opened this double knotted bag &amp; ate all of the chocolate, you suck &amp; owe my friend 3$ because this wasn’t even mine. I was holding it for her. please think twice before opening someone's double Knotted bag of goods that you didn’t even pay for!!”My sister comes in, reads my note, &amp; automatically is like why would you write this this is so mean. I explain the situation and she’s like ok but what if they were just having a bad day…? What..? I obviously ask her was it you since your being so defensive and she denies. I actually believe her because she actually really doesn’t even like chocolate. we go back and fourth because the math isn’t mathing on how she thinks it’s okay for someone to go through someone else’s stuff because they’re…having a bad day??I tell her next time I’m having a bad day I’ll help myself to her room and whatever she has in there opened or not. I also tell her she would have the same reaction if someone did that to her belongings (reminder, this was my friends candy not even mine so i was even more mad.) I go to her room and start pretending to go through her stuff and yell at her saying next time I’m having a bad day, I’ll go through your shit! She’s really shocked at my reaction and Basically says I hurt her feelings, and I shouldn’t be yelling and cussing at her.

10tmzs9,80,"I (15F) took a jewelry making class at school where we got to make projects based on prompts and after the class ended, we got to take them home. My mother decided to display some of my creations in the living room.Today, I walked in on my mom and my sister, Erin (19F), talking about them. Erin was saying that the jewelry was cool, and my mother told her that since she keeps admiring it and saying that, then she should take it back to her room. I said that just because she thinks its cool, that doesn't mean it automatically belongs to her and she can do whatever she wants with it.My mother asked me whose is the jewelry then, which I thought was a weird question. I'm the one who made it, so it belongs to me, and I said as much. She told me that she ""made me,"" therefore everything that I make should be hers.Then, I asked her if everything that she owns is her mom then, following the same logic. I feel pretty guilty about bringing up my grandmother. She was neglectful and when present she was abusive to my mom. I know that she's been stressed recently with my grandmother spam calling and then proceeding to pretend that she can't hear anything.My mom started yelling at me, asking who buys the materials for the craft projects I make. The school gave me the supplies, so I'm not sure what the logic was there. She said the jewelry shouldn't be in a common area if it's something that belongs to me and how I should take it away because she doesn't want to look at it anymore, so I did. On my way up the stairs to my room, she kept yelling about how I eat the food she makes every day. I hate loud noises, so I just wanted to go back to my room as fast as possible.I think I might be TA here because I brought up my grandmother, especially knowing that my mom's been stressed recently. She told me about a week ago she woke up at 4 AM and couldn't go back to sleep because she had a nightmare about my grandmother standing over her. I wasn't thinking when I said it, and she might have believed I was comparing her to her abusive mother, which does make a lot of sense why that upset her.

I told him I was home but would have to take out the dogs at some point and that my mother wasn‘t home so there could be a short time frame in which nobody was home. He got really mad although we told him even if the parcel happened to arrive at a time when I‘m not home, the delivery person would probably give it to a neighbor or throw it in our staircase (our front door is always open) as they always do. He didn‘t want to hear it and got really mad at me and my mom… for not being home.Now, it‘s also raining like crazy.

I’m relatively introverted, but I’ve been working there for a few months, and I’m getting more comfortable talking to my other coworkers and having friendly conversations with them. However, one of my coworkers recently has started acting rude to me, and I’m not sure why. He (19 m) refuses to address me by name, and when he does, he confuses me with another girl (who looks nothing like me). He also continues to have an attitude when he talks to me, but is generally friendly to everyone else who works with us. Because of this, I don’t feel comfortable asking him questions when I need something done (whenever he works he’s over cashiers and baggers in a way, so we go to him for questions or concerns). Just last night we were closing the store, he was in charge of us closing. He was telling people they could clock out, and addressing them by name while doing so. Since he didn’t say my name, I assumed he wasn’t ready for me to clock out so I stayed at my register to find something to clean. And then maybe like 7 minutes later he randomly says with an attitude “Clock out already, what’re you doing?” Once again I didn’t know who he was talking to because he didn’t address anyone, but I looked up anyway and saw he must be talking to me. Then he tells me “I told you to clock out already, hurry up.” I try to be nice and respectful to everyone, but I was pretty pissed off by his attitude especially since there was no way I could have known he was talking to me since he didn't address me or make any attempt to either. I’m tired of his attitude and different treatment, and it confuses me because he was not like this to me at first, and was actually pretty respectful. I don’t want him to keep treating me like this so I was wondering if I should go to one of my bosses about his behavior, as I don’t feel comfortable speaking to him anymore.

10tnre5,97,"This is gonna be long so please bear with me. For context, my [F 20] mom [F 50] is a licensed doula, going for her doctorate in health sciences, has numerous degrees, is a professor in different areas of biology, etc. so she’s definitely smart but we don’t see eye to eye on most of the decisions she makes. She’s kind of a hippie in the sense that she also does reiki, she’s an herbalist- definitely a naturopath which I try and respect. Our home life right now is very chaotic. Me, my mom, and my two siblings [M 18, F 15] live in a small bi-level, and in October we took in my two cousins [F 18, M 15] fleeing Russia. On top of that, my brothers girlfriend [F 18] is living with us as well. The living arrangement is this- The three bedrooms upstairs are occupied by my two cousins and sister, my brother and girlfriend stay in two small bedrooms downstairs connected to a converted garage, and my mom and I sleep in a makeshift sort of bedroom area where we use furniture to divide the basement into my room, her room, and laundry room. (She used to have one of the bedrooms upstairs but wanted my two cousins to each have their own bedroom which of course was really considerate of her). Here’s where this is relevant-Normally I’m away at college and only really come home on the weekends, even then I sleep at my boyfriends house as I don’t like to be home. My mom has a client for her doula services who needs somewhere to give birth and she offered her my room. Reminder, this is a small basement area full of clutter that Im not even comfortable living in. Her plan is to move my furniture out of the way to put a birthing tub by my bed so this woman can have her baby there. Am I the asshole for just feeling like there’s gotta be a better solution? My mom says the woman doesn’t want to give birth in a hospital and doesn’t have the money for it. Apparently her own house is being renovated and she can’t give birth there so she has no other option. I feel bad for her but I also know my mom has a track record for making really irrational decisions that are not well thought through. Obviously the baby being born safely comes first in priority, but how would this work? A stranger is gonna give birth in my small house unmedicated inches away from all my belongings with five other kids in the house? I feel like it’s not a clean place to have a baby in? And my siblings/cousins don’t have anywhere else to go so everyone has to be there while she gives birth. My mom says that our discomfort with hearing her give birth is unnatural and that “humans lived this way for centuries” Am I selfish to feel like this plan is flawed? Am I selfish for feeling like there should be a sort of boundary here? I just genuinely don’t believe there’s not a better option and I sense that my mom has this kind of savior complex where she thinks she needs to do this for this woman instead  of putting energy into finding a better alternative for her.",AITA for not wanting someone to give birth in my room?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tnre5/aita_for_not_wanting_someone_to_give_birth_in_my/

She felt hurt and asked if it was difficult for me to call, which made me realize that my actions may have come across as insensitive. I responded by saying I had my reasons but couldn't explain, which only made her feel worse.The truth is, I've been feeling emotionally exhausted lately and pursuing a master's degree and moving into a new house has left me with little energy for social obligations. I used to be more proactive in making her birthday special, but over time I've found myself growing apart from her mentally and emotionally.She has faced many hardships, such as losing her mother and taking care of her younger siblings with her emotionally distant father. I understand why she would expect stability from me, but the pressure sometimes becomes too much to bear. Although she has other friends, she often complains about them or feels unable to connect with them emotionally. She sees me as one of the few people who truly understands her.However, we don't have much in common anymore and our conversations revolve around the same topics. I find myself feeling depleted after talking to her and feel like I'm doing it out of a sense of obligation, not because I actually want to talk to her.We bonded during a turbulent time in college, and she has been a supportive friend during my difficult times.

I just say it because I thought she genuinely forgot by accident. she looked at me and said ""yeah, I had to wash everything alone that's why I forgot"".

The only ones that said yes were my GF and My friend that I work with. I was livid at it as I didnt plan anything crazy, just drinks in my house as it would be free (moms away for that weekend) so i got mad at realising this and just cancelled the whole thing and instead planned something with a bunch of other friends in the city near me, i didnt do this because my close group dont like drinking there.

10uo9p1,8,"Typing on mobile so not grammatically or structurally correct. I (18 F) am currently enrolled in college. I have two roommates (both 18 F). Today, we had a dispute over chores. We all promised to do our own dishes. I have but sometimes the dishes weren’t clean enough and instead of telling me to wash them again they tossed the dishes back in the sink and never told me. Only one person does their chore most of the time. Their chore is trash. I have floors. The thing is I was not raised with fully wooden floors. All I did was vacuum carpet and even then it was when visitors or family came. I’m not used to doing the floors every week as the chore list hasn’t been changed since we came back from winter break and is supposed to switch. Roommate 1 has told me we don’t care about the chore list the floor is filthy because of me (my side which I apologized for). She has bathroom and has never cleaned it. Since I’m the messiest person in our room so I sweep once in awhile on my side. I often don’t have to clean the floors on my roommates sides because roommate 1 only stays over like once or twice a week. Roommate 2 barely makes messes. The last issue is my desk. I leave food on it for 1-2 day max and toss it. They have a tray that they leave snacks on often by their beds. I also have paperwork and journals and random things on it.

10svtv3,1340,"Myself (43M) and my wife (41F) have lived on our street for years with our two boys, James (12M) and Sam (6M). Every Saturday morning Sam and I have a ritual, he calls them our dude walks. We look for spiders, dig in the mud, and stop at our neighborhood park to play. It's sort of a standing meetup for a bunch of parents in the area.Recently a new family moved in the next block over. The mother mentioned that she had two boys too, Kyle (13M) and Aiden (7M). I told her about the Sat morning park group in case she wanted to meet some neighbors.When she showed up with Aiden it was clear he has special needs. The mom was friendly, she sat with all the parents while the kids played. Aiden is an enthusiastic player. Loud noises, banging on things, getting up in the other kids faces. The mom was good about correcting him, and he wasn't aggressive, just excited.The other kids are wary when he flails, but they include him in play still. One Sat he was having an especially tough day. I called Sam over for a snack. He said ""I don't want to play with Aiden, can we go home?"" So we left. The next day Aiden's mom came to my door. She told me that I should have talked to him about differently abled people instead of just abandoning her son. We agreed to talk to Sam.The next weekend Sam said hi to Aiden, they played together a bit, but when Aiden got loud again, Sam retreated to the highest platform where Aiden was scared to go. When Aiden asked him to be his partner for a game, Sam said no thank you. I felt that was fine. My wife still felt bad, so she invited them over.Aiden had one melt down but other than that it went fine. Afterwards Sam asked please could Aiden not come over again. I asked James what he thought of Kyle, he said that the kid was obnoxious and didn't smell great.The next weekend, Aiden destroyed my son's favorite toy. He snapped the arms and legs off. Sam yelled ""YOU ARE A VERY MEAN LITTLE BOY!"" I did not make him apologize, we just left.Now instead of going out in the morning, we go on Sat afternoon after Aiden has left the park. After a few weeks, some others started joining us. We didn't discuss why. But I suspect that they didn't all shift their weekend routine around solely because they missed my sparkling personality.Aiden's mom eventually got wind of it. I don't know how. She wrote us a long heartfelt letter. She felt I had not done enough to discourage Sam from ostracizing Aiden and that my ""pull"" in the neighborhood was influencing others to avoid her son now too.Sam has tried his best. He's verbalized his need for boundaries from Aiden to us three times now. James has also been clear that he doesn't like the brother, Kyle.

10tx197,82,4 months ago my (f21) boyfriend(m23)s mom told him that I was very good at soccer when I was a teenager and his grandpa had recruited me and found me a scholarship to play club. My mother declined because she didn’t want the commitment. His mom asked him not to tell me this. I found out from him today because his mom started to tell me everything except for my mom declining because I was talking about how bad I was at soccer. (I’ve been telling everyone I was bad at soccer my whole life. I never knew I was apparently really good). Anyways after we left he told me that my mom had declined and his mom told him four months ago and asked him not to tell me. This makes me feel betrayed because if it were the other way around I feel I would have told him. I don’t think there should ever be secrets in a relationship especially when this is about me.

My dad contacted me in 2015 and I agreed to meet him. I wouldn’t say that we discussed our issues, we rather concentrated on the present and the future. After few months of talking to him (we live in different states) he announced that he is having a baby with his girlfriend.

10sr0wi,4039,"I 23 am the oldest of five siblings and I am a full time student. I also have a part time job in my field but when I complete my after degree  my employer will take me on full time.  I make enough from part time to pay for school and put money aside. My siblings range from 20-10.  Both of our parents work full time. I have taken on a lot of the responsibilities for keeping everything running in the house.  I do the grocery shopping, the laundry as well as making suppers and doing meal prep so everyone has lunches ready to take every day. I also get all my siblings to do their part with regards to household chores.  For example my youngest brother is responsible for feeding and walking the dogs.  So I make sure that there is dog food in the storage and poop bags on the leash.  My dad works very long hours and my mom works 9-5 at a hard job.  Over Christmas I had a chance to buy a PS5 for myself so I did.  The rest of my family is still using a shared PS4.  I keep mine in my room and I do not share.  My parents started fielding complaints from my oldest brother about how I made so much money and I don't share the things I buy for myself.  Totally true.  So they had a talk with me where they brought this up.  I pointed out how much of the household work I did and they said it wasn't fair that o was earning so much money without contributing. They told me how much they expected from me.  I went to my room and did the math.  If I gave them what they wanted I would have about $800 a month left over.  If I dropped a couple of classes next semester I could go to almost full time hours with my employer and and it would only be one more year until I graduated with my second degree.  But I could afford my own place and I would have way more free time and disposable income.  I packed up and moved out. Everything I owned fit in my car.  I stayed at an Airbnb for two weeks until I could get everything sorted with an apartment, school, and work.  It was great.  I'm not going to lie I may have gone a little overboard on Tinder.  I couldn't have women over to my parents house.  I just moved into my own apartment.  I'm staying part time until I finish this semester.  I will work full time over the summer and go to a lighter class load/higher work hours in the fall.  My oldest brother has been tasked by my parents to do everything I used to do.  His chores have been split up with the other three.  They are all pissed at me for moving out.  My parents are upset that I left them in the lurch.  My siblings are mad that they all have more chores.  My oldest brother is especially salty because he has no free time to see his girlfriend and she isn't allowed in the house when my parents aren't home.  I'm enjoying my free time.  I bought myself a plant from IKEA.    I feel bad for screwing them all over but it didn't make sense for me to do all that work and pay rent on top.#EDITAll the chores were split fairly.

10tsk1q,48,"I [24F] wear semi-permeant hair extensions that are fused to your own hair by a specialist, and the cost of the hair and install is pricey. Hair alone usually runs me about $1200, and getting them installed is another $400. I also am tattooed, and my regular artist was away traveling but I was itching for a new tattoo. I have one on my neck that I have wanted to get colored. I figured that because the tattoo was already done, I was fine going to another artist and I called around a few of the ""walk in, no appointment needed"" shops in my area to ask if they’d color it in. I did end up finding one who had an opening. He was an older guy who did a lot of traditional work, so was fine to just put flat color. The tattoo starts behind my ear and wraps to the front of my throat. So artist had me down on a table on my side, with my hair pulled back. When he was done he gave me a mirror to look.  I immediately notice that there is blue ink splattered into my hair on the side of my head, and freaked out a little bit and asked the artist if he could wipe it off. He got short with me and wiped it a few times, but it wouldn't come out. Told me that I would have to go home and wash it with dish soap. I trusted his opinion, so I paid and left.When I got home I tried washing my hair but nothing would make it come out. I texted pictures to my stylist, and she confirmed that I would have to have the extensions in that area replaced entirely to fix.I emailed screenshots of the conversation to the shop owner. I said I was upset my hair had been ruined and that I would have to pay hundreds of dollars to fix. I also asked if it was normal for that much ink to be splattered (and, if so, why the artist hadn't warned me or covered my hair during?). Owner offered to refund me the cost of the tattoo so that I could put that towards having my extensions professionally fixed. I took the refund, and did use it to pay my stylist.I had been venting to friends in our group chat, and one friend “April” started laying into me saying I was being a ""brat"" by accepting the refund for something that wasn't the artists fault. She thinks that the shop will reimburse me by taking away the payment from the artist- I said that I figured the owner had some sort of refund budget as part of shop expenses but she called me naïve and said I had no idea how small businesses work. April also said that it's not the artist's fault I choose to wear expensive extensions, and would I have done that if it had only gotten on my actual hair that didn’t cost over a grand. I said that if fixing it was just as expensive then yes I would have. April acted like that was a ridiculous answer. She thinks I am being a Karen and that I should return the refund. My other friends are not picking a side, so they aren’t agreeing with April but they also aren’t disagreeing with her.

10ttqxs,32,"My husband and I have been renting a house for a few years now and recently our landlord has decided to sell. In an unusual move they asked if we would be interested in buying, we agreed we would, if the price was right. Fast forward a little while and I get a message from the landlord saying they have a price and are we still interested? The price is well over what husband and I think the property is worth and although not really outside of our affordability, more than we want to spend. We then look at some different properties in our range, put in some offers and one was accepted. I have also messaged the landlord back and said thanks but unfortunately too pricey. Landlord comes back and asks what our price range is and I tell her something which is actually a little lower than our full range. She then comes back to say the lowest they can accept is actually this amount, a price within our range and almost £10,000 less than she’d originally stated.The property we have had an offer accepted on is same bedrooms and roughly same size but has a garden and a drive which our current property doesn’t. It’s also on a lot cheaper(mainly cos it needs updating decor wise but that’s not an issue for us). I think the other property is a better investment as we have recently had a baby and the other property would be better longer term for him and a possible sibling to grow up in due to it having a garden and being in a much quieter area.Since the price of the current property has come down my husband seems to think we should stay where we are. I have been honest and told him, I still think they are asking for more than the property is worth and that I don’t see us living there for more than a few years whereas with the other property I could see us there maybe not for life but for a good length of time. I think he just wants to take the easy option as he has done this before when we faced a similar situation. He got a bit irate with me and now I’m wondering if I’m being an asshole for insisting we buy the other property?EDIT: over the weekend he has come round and realised that the other property is a better investment long term.I say the offer of buying the property is unusual as having had a similar situation a few years back we weren’t offered that option and others we know who have rented have also had the same experience of just being served a notice giving 60 days to move out.Also re offer accepted on the other property i dunno how it works elsewhere but here we can back out up to exchange and I think even then you have a 7 day grace period.

In certain situations, she didn't think about how her actions hurt people and in other cases, she thought about her actions but didn't care who she would hurt as long as she got what she wanted.

10ud01a,9,"Hello Reddit, this is my first post here. I have heard a lot of these stories, but now I finally have my own story. This is DnD related, but I assumed I could post it here since it's me wanting to approach the DM outside of the game.So, let me start by saying this is a sea campaign. We are a crew of adventurers/merchants. Delivery Boys kinda lol. Our captain (the player I think is getting a lot of favoritism) is a level higher than us, and from the very get-go, the DM decided he would be the Captain. Why? Well, because the player is the oldest according to our DM (even though we have a player or two who have a bit of age on that player). I myself am 21, although I am young and the character I'm playing wouldn't suit it well. So, we began and went through, and I started to notice that the captain was getting some exceptionally... Lucky things. Legendary Magic Items (we started at level 3. We are level 4 now. He was a level ahead of us), stronger weapons, more loot.Now, look, I get he's the captain. But the explanation he gave for having him have a higher level is because he's an experienced sailor in his backstory. The thing is, some of us have that same sorta backstory where we have prior experience. But this lead to a head (at least in my mind). Last session, we did an extremely hard dungeon where we fought a crazy set of final bosses (A Zombie Beholder, Ogre, Skeletal Owlbear, and a Warlock with a Flame Tongue Longsword. All of them given multiattack (if they didn't have it already). I spent my time wailing on the warlock because he was the main threat in my character's eyes. I did get something from him (Maybe the talisman his powers are tied to, I still have no clue), but the captain immediately grabs the flame tongue long sword (OH yeah, he's a fighter whose level 5 and already is outdamaging everyone because... Well, you know... Extra Attack and Action Surge and Two weapon fighter).I am feeling frustrated because it feels like everything is specifically meant to go to him. Hell, when this DM's son was playing, he had a specific side question that would give a super powered weapon specifically for his son. I usually am a total doormat, but I really like DnD and the idea of this campaign. These are my friends, but I'm starting to feel the closer friendships are going to keep being handed out powerful stuff while everyone else is stuck kinda sprawling. Would I be the asshole if I approached the DM to perhaps explain how I feel?Quick edit: To clarify, I'm playing Bloodhunter (at my DM's request), so I am a Frontliner too",WIBTA if I approached my DM about possible Favoritism,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ud01a/wibta_if_i_approached_my_dm_about_possible/

10txxns,18,"I work in a secured environment where there's Tier 1, Tier 2 and System Administrators that work there along with some supervisors and a boss. Last year I managed to catch a job announcement that was for a Tier 2 position and decided to apply for it. None of the other Tier 1s saw it because none of us got an email saying they put it out.When my coworker discovered this after the announcement has closed, he came to talk to me about it and said if he knew, he would have applied because he's been there for years and feels as though he was ready for it. I told him I decided to back out because I changed my mind and I wasn't gonna apply again because I didn't think I wanted it. Flash forward to last month and another Tier 2 job opened again. I mentioned it to him and he applied to it. I told him good luck and since none of the other Tier 1s wanted it or had enough experience, he would probably get it in favor of outside applicants.However, after thinking about it and talking to a few friends and some coworkers, I have decided to apply. A supervisor said at least it would be good interview practice and another said that he would've done the same if I was in his position. A coworker said that he's been here for years and 3 people that came after him have already been promoted to Tier 2. I just feel conflicted that I had given him my word, but changed my mind. I feel that I have a great shot considering all the extra work I've done from reorganizing our media inventory to helping out and even getting some System Admin responsibilities to help out. I feel like he would be upset if I managed to get it before him, but it seems like he's riding on how long he's been there rather than his contributions to get the job.AITA?",AITA for telling my coworker I wouldn’t apply for the internal position but did anyways?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10txxns/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_i_wouldnt_apply_for/
10tmeie,60,"My (30f) husband (33m) and I got married three years ago, we have a three year old daughter and a good relationship between us. However, his mother never liked me or even pretended to. At all my in-laws' family celebrations that I attended, she made a point of calling my husband's ex wife. They broke up 5 years ago, but my mother-in-law has not gotten over the breakup and continues to insist on their reconciliation even though he is married and has a daughter. The reason for this is because in addition to being my husband's first wife, she is the daughter of his mother's best friend who died, so she has always treated her like a daughter. Initially I didn't care about the bad treatment, as I thought that after we announced that we were getting married, her penny would sink in. But it wasn't like that. She called my husband's ex wife to my wedding without my permission, called her to my husband's birthdays and all with the excuse that ""she is family"". I couldn't stand it, but I got over it for my husband and our daughter's sake. Last week, my father-in-law passed away due to a medical condition that had no treatment. The whole family was sad because he was an amazing man. Unlike my mother-in-law, he always liked me and said I was a good person, unlike my husband's ex-wife because she was bad for his son (his words). We traveled about 2 hours to get to the place where the funeral would take place. It wasn't two minutes before we arrived and my mother-in-law was already making a scene against me, yelling things like: ""This is your fault"", ""you're a homewrecker "" and ""I wish it was you"". She tried to stop me from seeing my father-in-law, but my husband wouldn't let me and I was able to briefly say a final goodbye. My daughter was at the reception with my sister-in-law as I didn't want her to see her dead grandfather. After a while I went to stay with her so that my sister-in-law could stay with her father. Shortly after, my husband's ex wife comes in and looks at me at the reception with a strange smile and greets me saying that she was very sorry about the death of ""her father-in-law"" and that it is a difficult time for everyone.I foamed with rage and the only reason I didn't attack her was because of my daughter. I spoke to my husband and he said he wouldn't leave as it was his father's funeral. I understood him, but if I stayed one more second in that place I would have a fit. I called an Uber and left home because I didn't want to stay there with my daughter who also wanted to leave. On the same day he called me asking where I was, when I said I was at home he yelled at me asking how I had the nerve to do this to him when he needed me. I explained why I didn't want to stay there anymore, but even then he said that I was heartless and empathetic to him and could have waited. Now he's not talking to me and I'm wondering if I was an AH. So AITA?

They’ve been together about 2 months. Nala is a nice girl I met her once but Bree has never had any interest in woman. Her whole childhood was her obsessing over Justin Bieber or One direction, her whole room was filled with posters of them. She knew she could be comfortable coming out if she was. She’s made comments to her brother how it feels weird kissing her, and she doesn’t know how their moms do it. My wife and I both agreed that this was just college experimenting. I know this is a new world, but I also know my daughter.A few days ago we were on the phone and Bree told me Nala was telling her she should quit her extra curricular, and focus on her major. I reminded her that without soccer she has no scholarship, and how she expected to pay for it. Well of course Nala has this idea on how to handle it. We got into a pretty heated argument over it. She said something to me like “You guys don’t care about my mental health like Nala does!” I snapped and told her “stop saying that your not even gay!” She got upset and called me a “mega AH” and accused me of being “homophobic” (even tho I’m gay) told me she was dropping soccer, and hung up the phone.  She won’t return my calls or text and she lives 4 hours away on campus. I got a little crazy and looked Nala up on Facebook and texted her asking her to have Bree get back to me, and Nala left me on seen.

10u5tw8,15," I (F26) bought a van in Dec, my friend (M35) had offered to help me with it as something we could do together. The option of just cleaning and fixing it up to sell was talked about from the very beginning as backup.We worked on it together. He would insist on buying parts I didn’t need or Intended to pay for myself. He wouldn’t always let me pay him back &amp; insisting. I started to feel pushed into accepting help I couldn’t easily return. He would drive it around &amp; didn’t always disclose to me his usage. At one point he used it to tow without proper equipment &amp; didn’t tell me.In Jan, he would complain to others that I was not contributing when it had only been due to bad weather. Hesring other mean things said behind my back causd me to feel uncomfortable with the commitment. I had confronted him nicely about it &amp; he lied then continued to talk shit to others. My dog started having expensive health problems, causing financial &amp; personal reasons to give up the van.  Justly, he was unhappy to hear this, but I offered him first dibbs, low cost (2k) &amp; 3months to pay. He couldn’t afford it, asking for more time, but I would be out of state then &amp; do not wish to hound my friends for payments. Plus the van would already be in his possession. He suggested I look elsewhere. When I did, he flipped a switch. Suddenly there were issues with the van I was unaware of.  Which of course his reasoning was that he wanted to fix and replace it all as a “surprise” after I already told him to stop being so generous &amp; let me pay for things myself.  Considering I wasn’t previously aware of these issues, I assumed it was something he caused with his usage. I was wrong. Before, things seemed fine. wheels were offered as a cosmetic upgrade &amp; I said no if it’s in good working condition. He had the opportunity to tell me about the issue &amp; decided not to. Plus, I didn’t understand “busted front end” to me meant front of the vehicle which is where he towed from &amp; assumed he caused that. He claimed he had to park it weeks ago, but had driven it a few days before without telling me.  He finally admitted he was upset I was asking for 2k when he thinks his contribution should lower it, but didn’t communicate it. We both apologized &amp; tried to move forward. I asked how much I’d owe him &amp; he said I didn’t. No number or list of his work. So, I planned to pay him 10%, and offer an installation to the buyer for $200 for him.I thought all was well until he vented to my girlfriend that he was upset because he did 1k worth of labor (never mentioned) &amp; that I was taking advantage of him &amp; blaming him for breaking the van… after we had just talked it out. She was taken aback by his sudden change in tone. I asked him if we needed to talk more things out.

10ts9i5,63,"I (25f) am the MOH of my best friend's (25f) upcoming wedding. I have spent almost a year &amp; over $1000 doing things for her bachelorette/ wedding. I have not complained once about anything, I have gone above &amp; beyond on gifts, decorations, &amp; plans to make everything perfect for her. I have asked her for zero to little help with anything. I live in about 3000 miles away from her, so travel has been an issue in planning &amp; $$ costs but I have flown there for all the big stuff (wedding dress shopping etc). The bachelorette is in May &amp; the wedding is in June. This last week she (the bride) decided to tell me that she invited my ex to her wedding. She did not ask me how I felt about it, simply just said she had already invited him. For some background context - he is not just any ex. He is a level 3 registered S/O. We dated in middle school &amp; highschool for many years. Per Reddit I am not allowed to go into detail the things he did to me &amp; other women. Let's just say he's horrible &amp; ended up in prison for it.  I had the power to put him away when we were 17 &amp; my family &amp; I had a full case with the district attorneys office. For my own personal reasons back then, I decided not to ruin this man's life at 17. Had I had known he would end up in prison anyway- I should have pursued the case. The bride said that she didn't think inviting him would be a big deal considering ""it's been YEARS &amp; we have both matured &amp; moved past it."" What he put me through was not something ever gets over in their entire lifetime. Further than that- when I did tell her I was uncomfortable with it she then proceeded to tell other bridesmaids that I was being ""selfish per usual."" She has two children of her own ( boy- 5, girl -8 months) so why she would want a registered S/O at her wedding anyway is beyond me. She says that he was her best friend in highschool &amp; they have matching tattoos (as if that's an excuse for who he is as a person). I could stomach being the bigger person &amp; still attending her wedding knowing he'd be there, even though my mother has made it clear she cannot be within 25 miles of him(she was invited as well). The reason I'm so upset &amp; no longer want to be in her wedding/ her friend at all is her treatment towards me in all of this. She has bad mouthed me to other bridesmaids behind my back &amp; could not understand why this might bother me at all. I have bent over backwards to make everything perfect for her &amp; spent thousands of $ of my own money for everything. To me it seems I'm the bad guy no matter what I do- so now I have no desire to be around her or continue to finish the bachelorette/ spend more of my $ to be at her wedding. My entire family + friends + other bridesmaids we grew up with have all agreed this is fd up &amp; shouldn't have been an issue from the first place. She still doesn't see an issue with it.

I also learned that when you don't have money people expect you to do whatever they want you to do to get money. That is why I learned to only do things that I really want to do and not bec other people want me to do.Whenever I visit my bf I feel uncomfortable because I don't really get along with his parents. bf is an only child and treats his parents like gods (maybe a bit exaggerated but you get what I mean) and he expects me to also treat them like this.His mum (MIL) buys me a lot of 'stuff' for christmas etc. I tell her everytime that I don't want gifts, but she keeps doing it. I talked to my bf about that but he said something like ""let her do that. It's her love language"" I replied ""I feel uncomfortable receiving gifts and I want her to stop"". He didn't say anything to that. Back to last christmas. She got me a bunch of 'stuff'. bf gave me the presents in private bec he was visiting me. He then asked ""aren't you happy?"" I replied ""no. I didn't want anything and these are things I won't use"". He got upset and wanted me to text his mom thank you. I said okay and did bec I want to keep the peace.Let's talk about the title.

He said ""you don't know if you like this cake until you  taste it"" i shaked my head and said ""no thank you, I don't want cake right now"".

I ended up moving out of state but we all frequently play video games together and go on trips so we are all just as close. Well besides one guy “Darren”. He’s still a good friend of mine, but doesn’t share the same interests anymore. Doesn’t game with us. Never goes on trips or out with us when I’m in town. (He’s always invited he just never comes). Long story short, when it came to wedding party selection, I obviously have my brother and her brothers and whatnot. But I included the 4 guys from the group. Not Darren. Of course he’s still invited to the wedding and at a table with other friends he knows. Over the past few months I’ve been hearing through the grapevine things Darren is saying. Things like he’s upset that my wedding is in my home state, I’m being a dick for making people travel, and he might not come because of the expenses and time off work.

10txq37,39,"I 28f have a 1 year old daughter. My husband (30m) and I have had a rule with our extended family about posting photos of our child on social media. We ask that they get permission from one of us before posting any photos as we don't want their pictures floating around to people we do not actually know ourselves. We understand that they want to share photos of their grandchild and niece/nephew, but we wanted to minimize it.  So, to be clear, it's allowed to have some photos of the child up. we just asked that they check with us beforehand, so nothing we might find inappropriate, like mostley naked/bath photos or anything cringe/weird. Backstory. My MIL has always had an issue with boundaries and very much so has the mind set of ""I raised 4 kids so I know better than you"" and ignores the boundaries we have put in place like no eating in the carseat while driving or no soda pop for the baby. Pretty basic things I feel like we shouldn't have had to outwardly express, but seeing her do this with our older nieces and nephews has warned us to put the boundaries in place from the get go. My husband and I rarely post photos of our kid on social media. I have about 5 photos from the first 18 months of their life, and my husband literally just has the birth announcement photo.I took about a 3 week hiatus from fb. During that time, my MIL posted about 30 photos of our child without asking my husband or I prior to posting them. Some were from the holidays, which I understand they are going to be in the background of the other grandkids' photos. but others were just random. I'm peeved by this, and it's frustrating that she honestly doesn't care about any boundaries we have out in place. My husband is annoyed, but let's most things go because she is impossible to argue with and always makes herself out as the victim and everyone else is the aggressor. Now the photos are not necessary a hill I am willing to die on. However, I do want to ask her to delete them so she understands that we are serious, and hopefully, she respects the rules we have put in place regarding social media. The photos have been up for about 6 weeks at this point. AITA, if I ask her to take them down and check with us before posting photos in the future?

My husband works in cyber security as a red team operative. Basically, an 'ethical hacker' where his team is hired to steal information from companies then write reports on what they were able to steal and how so companies can fix the vulnerabilities before being hacked for ransom. So he's pretty sketched about having personal info online at all.I work in emergency medicine and have had/seen/heard terrible stories of SA and trafficking and how it was something as simple as ""sharing a location"" while at a restaurant or park and having a public profile.

10ujlau,20,"Okay, so a little body context; I have a friend with whom I have developed a ""situationship"". Let's call him N; N &amp; I are not committed but we have casual fun &amp; we have had a talk about what's on the table &amp; what is not. Each time a new situation arises, I ask his opinion &amp; thoughts on the matter &amp; behave accordingly. One time I was exposed to a situation where I had received unsolicited pictures. It made me uncomfortable since N's feelings were to be considered as well &amp; I felt he'd feel troubled by it. So to clear off any confusion, I asked if sexting &amp; receiving images were alright (eg. prompting explicit photos to be sent from other people, encouraging it, etc.) &amp; he said no. Since we both work at the same company, I requested his help with checking a few files from my side (he works under my peer). I had blamed him for quality issues as he maintains extremely careful checks with her whereas he increases my workload with the quality of checks ensured. This had been going on for the 3 days. Today we got a chance to meet, everything was lightly patted under the dirt &amp; I agreed to myself to let it slide since I'm an extremely strict evaluator as compared to his manager. I had his phone in hand so I decided to change his wallpapers (he doesn't mind me having his phone). But in his gallery, I noticed a snap image of a girl showing off her body figure. So I questioned him about it &amp; he told me she sent it out of the blue &amp; asked to rate it. Viewing an image &amp; letting it go is alright. But viewing it &amp; saving it to the phone- I'm unsure of how to feel about it. This was not told to me either. Since we had ground rules set on this where I tell him everything &amp; ask his opinion, he doesn't do the same with me. His response was ""I didn't know I should've asked"". This troubled me since I've been asking &amp; do not receive the same sort of consideration.Overall, I had been extremely pissed at the situation &amp; blocked him everywhere except on 1 platform so that he can still ask for help if he needs.

I had attempted this exam last year too but failed.I have a college classmate who likes to go around asking everybody who gives any competitive exams if they passed or failed. We don't talk much in class just on texts and that too just work related or if she needs notes or something.The 1st time she asked me about this was just after I had given my 1st attempt and found I failed. I noticed that she seemed really excited to talk about this topic and went around asking every classmate of mine who had given this exam what their results were.I thought that even she must have given this exam and wanted to discuss about it. But I later found that she hadn't. The way she jumped from one classmate to another so excitedly wanting to talk about it felt kinda weird to me. But I ignored it.Now, a few days before the results of my 2nd attempt were to be declared, while I was chatting with some of my friends &amp; classmates, she came up to me again and excitedly asked me if I was waiting for the result and nervous about it or not. She also asked if this was 2nd attempt and when I said yes she got quiet and gave me look like she was judging/looking down on me. She did this in front of some of our classmates who I wasn't very close to and didn't comfortable telling this news too.And I was very much nervous about it. I am the type of person who puts much importance on academics, all my life I have always gotten good grades and always did well in whatever academic task I took up. I was so scared about this result that I put it out of my mind and had completely forgotten about it. I acted cool in front of my friends and classmates but inside I was was a nervous wreck.Today I got a message from her asking me again very excitedly if I had checked my results and I had passed or not. She already sent a congratulatory message without even knowing if I had passed or not. She may have just been being hopeful for me, but again I had forgotten about the result date and had a little panic attack reading her message. I quickly checked my result and I had passed.So, a while later I texted her thanks.She immediately asked to see my result page as if she didn't believe me and was acting very condescending. I told her I am not going to show her my results.I didn't feel comfortable sharing that with her and I had a feeling that she was just going to comment on how the marks I got very quite low or how her other friends had gotten more.I asked her why she wanted to see it and she avoided the question and just insisted that I show it to her.

He couldn’t join the military for skin reasons, he’d need ointment all the time and they don’t allow that so he decided to become a police officer. The problem is that we live in a large city.  A city that has frequent protests and crime. He doesn’t have the mindset of some cops, he just literally wants to help but not everyone will see that. I’m truly scared he’s going to get hurt and killed because of this.I told him I’m scared of him getting seriously hurt because of the outrage on police lately, but he says he can change it. I told him he’s kind of ignorant in thinking one police officer doing right will change everyone’s minds and that no matter how much good you do you can still get killed.

My parents both work full-time and they usually ask me to babysit my sister on weekends. I've been doing this for a while now and I don't mind it most of the time, but this weekend I have plans with my girlfriend since she will be away with her family on valentine's day.Here's the problem: my parents are asking me to cancel my plans and stay home to babysit my sister who is also having some friends over, yes I knew I was going to have this problem when I told my girlfriend that we can do stuff for the next couple days, but my parents usually don't mind me being busy and will usually ask one of our neighbors to care care of her, so none of this would be an issue if if I hadn't learned last night that her friends were also coming over, so I need to make them food and whatever else, we couldn't possibly ask anyone else to do that (and yes the girls have come over before so I know how to deal with them, their parents trust me as well.)I understand that my parents are working the weekend, but I  need a break from my responsibilities to enjoy my time. I've been working harddd to graduate and get into college lately and I just need a weekend off. I've been looking forward to this for a while now and I don't want to give it up.  I've tried to talk to my parents about this and I've told them that I don't want to give up my plans but they don't care. They say that I'm the only one who can take care of my sister and that I need to be more responsible since I don't pay rent, don't have a job, had to redo my senior year of hs (that's a whole other story) and have been living for free.I understand their point of view, but I feel like I've been taking care of my sister a lot lately and I just need a break.  I've also suggested that they ask one of their friends or family members to help out this weekend, but they don't want to impose on anyone else. I don't know what to do.

Maybe 10 minutes go by and she asks me where her chicken nuggets are, so I told her. Now she's pissed because she doesn't have much other food in and had changed her mind. This is rare, due to her germophobic nature- she'll reclean utensils over and over until they fit her standards, and won't hug me if I've been outside.Despite this, I do feel guilty as I was the one pointing out the door was clean, and I knew there wasn't much food left in the house, so am I the asshole?",AITA for putting her food in the garbage,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tkkns/aita_for_putting_her_food_in_the_garbage/
10tyshw,35,"I (37m) am a domestic abuse survivor. I ended up at this house because I had to escape and my friends showed up for me. I will always be grateful for that. The house is owned by (40m) and also rented out by (32f). For this we will refer to them as M and F.M is very seclusive and has half of the house to himself. As he should. It's his house. F and I share a bathroom but have our own rooms next to each other. Once a week, around 7 or 8pm I will have my girlfriend over. Most of the time we just get takeout to eat while we watch a movie and then fall asleep. And we sleep. Think 11pm to 1pm (don't judge us). The next day I'll make some coffee and we will watch a show or play games until she goes home or we go out for dinner. The entire time she stays in my room unless she has to pee. It's not like we are being loud or obnoxious in any way. I even schedule it so that my roommates are usually gone for work since they get back at around 3am. The problem comes with F. She has an absolute meltdown every time. As soon as she gets a clue that my girlfriend is over she starts cursing and slamming things. She will go to the bathroom, slam the lid down when she's done, stomp across the hall, slam her door, and proceed to bang around in her room. It almost sounds like she's angrily assembling Ikea furniture. All the while I hear her cursing out loud. ""Fucking (girlfriend's name).""Before you get any ideas, she has her own boyfriend. I know him well and I am always respectful when I see him. We get along. It's fine with me. If he comes over I just throw in earbuds and read or draw. No biggie. Let them be.I confronted her once and she told me that my girlfriend is loud and makes a mess. To be fair, she does have a loud laugh. I love it. But we are asleep before anybody gets home until after they are already up. The mess part? I was told that there was a tampon wrapper in the bathroom trash. In the trash that I change out every day. Other than that she never even leaves the room because she is terrified of F at this point.On a side note, F will be just fine the rest of the week. But she is hyper-invasive. She just walks into my room and digs through my things to see what I have or look for candy. She will sit on my bed and light up a bowl and rub the ashes she drops into my sheets. I don't smoke weed but it doesn't bother me to be around it. It all stresses me out so bad that we have started looking for our own place. Which we wanted to do anyways. But in the meantime, it just doesn't seem like I'm doing anything to deserve this behavior.EDIT to provide additional information below:I was in a very abusive relationship for a long time. Nobody knew but I eventually cracked and told everyone. Next thing I know everyone is trying to help me. So I end up at this house living with two coworkers. I no longer work with them, but they are still there.M is very private. He owns the house but we mostly leave him alone. A bit eccentric in a quiet way. Never really speaks but sleeps in a tent in his room and cooks things at 4am. He can be very messy, but the kitchen is the only crossover point.F is adventurous. Always needs to be doing something otherwise she spirals into depressive episodes. She got mad once when I joked that she is the classic Hollywood manic pixie type. She has broken up with her boyfriend three times for one week since I moved here. You get the picture.I am a very quiet person. Like weirdly quiet. People crack jokes that I never stop talking. And it's the same living with me. I even walk quietly. Accidentally scare the shit out of people all of the time. I mostly keep to my room. When I eat, it is mostly takeout or microwave. I have my own coffee maker, paper towels, trash, recycling, and dishes. And I wash my few dishes with my own little soap and sponge in the bathroom. Super bachelor style.

10tvlr9,44,"I (23F) live with my parents (50s) and brother (24M), and am about to celebrate my one year anniversary with my boyfriend (23M) next month.To make a long and annoying story short, my boyfriend is not allowed to sleep over at my house, even when my parents are out of town (which is quite often). He’s not even allowed in my room when he visits, and we usually hang out in the basement.As annoying as this would be in any case, I wouldn’t really have a problem with this rule if it weren’t for the fact that this rule applies only to me and not to my brother as well. My brother had a girlfriend (that he recently broke up with) that was allowed to spend the night whenever she wanted. They started dating when my brother was 20 and were together for 3.5 years, but she started to spend the night early into their relationship (maybe about a month or two in). At one point her parents moved her elderly grandmother into her room when she became ill, and as a result she lived with us for six months. In my parent’s defense, this was not discussed beforehand. She just came to spend the night one day and didn’t go to her own house to sleep for 6 months straight. But they accommodated her without question, giving her a key to the house and a garage opener, and treating her like another member of the family and the household. It hurts me to know that this sort of kindness and acceptance would never be extended to my boyfriend.I try my best to suck it up and abide by their rules, but it has caused so much resentment in me that we have arguments about it occasionally. Especially because they get upset when I sleep over at HIS house and tell me that I’m not allowed to stay at his past 10pm on a school night (this used to be the rule in general, but I stood my ground and told them not to bother me about coming home early on the weekends. Even then, I still am home before midnight). They even get mad at me when I go to his house too many times in a row, and they say that he is the man, so he should be coming to visit me. I tell them that they’re being sexist and I’m only getting this treatment because I am a woman and that I don‘t want to hear their complaints because it was never an issue when my brother was doing it. Their response to this is, “It’s not because you‘re a woman, it’s because you’re a DAUGHTER and you will never understand until you have kids.”Before anyone asks or mentions it: I cannot move out. We live in a very expensive city and I am a full time graduate student. I am very financially dependent on my parents right now. They are great and generous parents, but this is a huge point of contention between us.I will continue to follow their rules, and deal with them being upset when I break their weird rules about visiting him.

10ttgkc,45,"So I (22F) have a boyfriend Kyle (23M) that i currently live with. He has 3 friends/housemates and I have been staying with them for about a month. The place I worked at closed for good and I couldn’t keep up with bills for my own apartment so my boyfriend and his friends allowed me to stay with them. I have been trying to get a job, I’ve been applying to places and searching online but haven’t gotten any response. Kyle and his friends have been very understanding of my situation and have told me to not worry about rent until I can get a job. Since I haven’t gotten a job yet, I’ve been doing what I can to help around the house with chores and cooking. I do dishes, laundry and other things like that when they are working and I make food for them a lot. I have some money saved so i spend some of it on buying the ingredients for the food I make. I make whatever they ask for even if sometimes they want different things. I always make a lunch for them to bring to work and then also either dinner or breakfast every day. Kyle has no issue with me making lunches for his friends and he think it’s nice of me to do that. His friends are always very nice and thankful for the food, sometimes if they want something specific they’ll buy the stuff for it themselves and ask if I can make it. Recently Kyle and his friends invited some of their family over for dinner. Everyone took part in making and bringing food for the dinner. Kyle’s parents were there and they had asked how I was doing living with the guys here. I told them how I was doing good and that I’m still hunting for jobs but haven’t gotten any luck but that the guys here have been very nice to me. Kyle and his friends chimed in and talked about how I do chores and make food for them. They explained to them how I make specific food for them a lot and praised me for it. After the dinner when we were cleaning up, Kyle’s mom came to me and asked why I’m acting like a housewife to Kyle’s friends. I asked what she meant by that and she says I shouldn’t be acting like a housewife for all the men I come across, that I have a boyfriend and should be focusing on him. I told her I do focus on Kyle, that me and him share a room and spend time together all the time when he isn’t working. She wouldn’t listen and said I’m putting his friends over him. I ended up just walking away and that made her more upset. She later texted Kyle and told her how rude I was to her for ignoring her. Kyle asked me what happened and I told him what she said to me. He confronted her and said she should mind her own business but she said she was just defending him. Kyle’s dad agrees with his mom and thinks I’m doing too much for his friends and not enough for Kyle.

10uued9,18,"So for context, I am a transgender (female to male) teenager in the southern region of the united states. My parents do not know and neither do most adults. I am in high school and am out to most (if not all) of the students in my grade. Since my parents don’t know, there are often times I have to dress feminine because I have something to do after school or they want to take pictures to remember some special occasion. Therefor, there have been a handful of days (I want to say like ten max) where I have showed up to school in dresses, blouses, skirts, etc. While I understand that doesn’t effect some trans people, it causes more dysphoria for me. It was spirt week which meant my parents wanted pictures so I had to dress feminine. This particular day was early 2000s stereotypes (I could be wrong but it was something along those lines.) I was wearing a skirt, knee high socks, a stripped white tee shirt, and a varsity jacket. I hated the outfit to all hell but I couldn’t really complain. I went through 90% of the day with the occasional stare and whisper but that was about it. Until 7th period. I walked in and one of my friends, we’ll call him Eric, called me over to sit down. When I sat down Eric looked at me . “Hey, Jessica (not their real name) has been going around saying you are ‘faking being trans.’”I was shocked. Me and Jessica got along pretty good so I had no idea why they would say that. This is important later, Jessica is non-binary. I always saw Jessica at the bus stop so I decided to confront them. I said something along the lines of “Who tf do you think you are going around telling people that I’m faking being trans?” A they explained that it was a mockery of the trans community that I come to school dressed in skirts if I “claim to be ftm.” I will be the first to admit that I probably got a little too mad. “Excuse the fuck out of me? It is not your fucking place to tell me my own identity. I have a reason I have to dress like this but frankly that is non of your business. I’m sorry that your parents don’t love you and to feel validated you have to pick on other people but I promise you there are better ways to solve your daddy issues.” After I said that they stormed off and their little group kept bother me and trying to make me feel bad.

He told me when he got his N , I wouldn’t have to pay for cabs anymore. Also when he’d cab to my house which wasn’t as often as I’d go to his, I’d almost always pay for his. Before this incident I’m about to go into he offered me his card to pay for a cab since I couldn’t afford one due to my cat getting sick and he had a huge vet bill. Then I get to his house and he asks for the money back when I get paid.Well the other day he picks me up and right before he picks me up he asks me to give him $10 for gas money, he is driving his sisters truck. He told me that it’d be 20 for gas just to drive me from work to his house. He says I’m paying for half. I feel like that isn’t right. It’s a 10 minute drive. I usually wouldn’t care but it sounded like a lie. There is no way it’s 20 dollars.

They have a young son and the woman is expecting their second child soon.  We have two children and the sister has been our go to babysitter for a year and a half now.   She is great and the kids adore her.   We thought about asking her if she wanted to live with us since we have much more room than her sister's family.  She approached us last month and said that when her sister gave birth she would be watching her nephew while her sister was at the hospital.  She asked that if by chance our plans overlapped with the child birth if she could bring her nephew with her while she watched my children.  I said I would think about it and talk about it with my husband.  He thinks it's fine.  I'm not sure.  If we are paying her she should only be watching our kids.   I don't think she can give attention to three children and the boy might be distracted by his siblings birth or make a mess.  I don't know.  I offered the compromise that we could bring our children to their home for babysitting.  I thought this was fair since we would be responsible for taking them over and picking them up and we would have to deal with waking them up.  She said it's not her house and that it is really small and not set up for that many kids.  For example they only have one tv. So if one child wants to watch a movie the other ones can't play on their switch.   The baby is due right away and we tried to book her for last night.  She said she couldn't make any guarantees because the baby could come at any moment and she didn't want to cancel on us at the last minute.

10sud8l,587,"**ATIA for starting a bathroom remodel for my daughter COMPLETELY FREE and stopping and pulling materials after her husband slammed the door in my face?**  My daughter was pregnant and wanted her bathroom redone.  I have 2 contractors who are very close friends of mine.  I offered to remodel her bathroom 5 months ago but her husband declined.  Then a month before she was due, they asked if we could do it.  I scheduled it with contractors, even though she was very close to her due date.  (We told her she should wait).  Regardless, she wanted to move forward.  We started on Saturday and Wednesday night she tells us she is being induced the next day.  We work as fast as we can and get to the point where we are hooking the toilet back up and ready to set the tub.  Then my contractor that does the plumbing gets covid.  So with a newborn at home by Saturday, I don't want him in the house obviously. So daughter and husband come home Saturday morning and I suppose the guys didn't sweep well enough so she loses her shit and starts crying about how the bathroom isn't done and the house is a wreck.  Spoiler: They live in filth, it was always a wreck.  Anyways, I wait til Monday to reach out to her to see if we can come over to finish.  She tells me they already have a guy coming to install the toilet and that she would like her car keys back.  I drive over to drop off the keys, and her husband is waiting for me at the door.  He grabs the keys and slams the door in my face. Okay, so my daughter texts me later that day and says that she's going to have a contractor finish the rest because we lied to her about the timeline and I am holding this project over her head.  I am furious now, so I calmly tell her that I will be back that day to pick up anything that hasn't been installed and they can finish as they see fit.  I figure, if her husband can slam a door in my face when I am trying to gift a 10-15k remodel to them, then I don't need to supply materials for this anymore and they can figure it out.  He then texts me ""F#$% you you ruined my paternity time.  I want nothing to do with you.  You'll never see your granddaughters again."" (a longer string of insults but you get the picture.). I calmly responded to him that it sucks to use your kids as a weapon on their grandparents, but he had to do what he had to do.  Now his mom is calling us because they cannot afford the remodel AND he stays off from work like planned.  My thought is why should I gift anything to a guy to who I've already given 10's of thousands of assistance when he talks to me like that?  I feel like I'd be a chump. Also, side note, we offered to have them stay with us while the bathroom was being completed.

10tz7rn,13,"To preface this story it happened a few years ago but I still think about it from time to time and wonder could I have been wrong.I had a best friend who basically lived with me while we were in HS. We were inseparable. Like sisters. We had a lot of ups and downs but I’m going to focus on a specific event. My now ex bestfriend had just gotten married. She was having a lot of issues in her marriage and would often project her negative emotions onto my relationship with my then partner. She would go to him for advice every now and then and would turn around and throw the advice he gave her in his face to criticize him with things he was doing “poorly” in my relationship with him. I got tired of getting in the middle of their arguments and I told him it’s your choice to stop giving her advice but I want no parts of this.One day she posted on Facebook “it’s hard to find love in this generation” I saw the post and chose to ignore it as did most of our friend group because we just  knew that she was having one of her moments and it wouldn’t be wise to interfere. And it’s Facebook. But my ex Partner decided to comment “you don’t look for love in this generation, you let it find you” I, personally didn’t see anything wrong with his comment. But apparently this sent her off the edge. At this point I was working for a really well known surgeon in NYC who had a strict no phone policy on the job. Thankfully for me, I always adhered to it because this particular day was what ended our friendship.  My ex Bestie didn’t like the comment and proceeded to antagonize him through the comments. To which my ex partner responded “you’re a smart girl, you know I had no I’ll intentions with my statement” This lead to her threatening his life by saying she’d get her army husband to “handle” him. Somehow, everyone got involved in the post from her family to friends. He in my opinion rightfully defended himself but I told him, I warned him to not get involved in her nonsense. But he didn’t listen. On a weird turn of events, I was being slandered in her comments with people asking me “how could you date someone like *blank*”I was so frustrated I basically laid into her on Facebook telling her that she needed to focus on her marriage instead of being on Facebook crying every other day and trying to ruin other peoples relationships. Needless to say, she sent a screenshot of what I said to my mom and got my partner kicked out of the house. Everyone told me I was a horrible friend who was choosing her boyfriend over her bestfriend. We haven’t spoke to each other since.

10u8ez0,21,"I’ve been walking a lot more on the treadmill lately and my mom doesn’t like it when I walk for longer than 3 miles, since I can walk 6-9 miles. I’d detail why she’s concerned, but I don’t want to divulge details about family matters. She also thinks I do it too late at night because when I finish and wash up at night, she says it interferes with her desire to get ready for bed by 10PM, even though there’s nothing stopping her from getting ready for bed before or when I wash up, and she normally spends time on the computer or watches TV until past 12AM. I’ve been making an effort to walk several hours earlier in the day, and I don’t plan to do it for longer than a month (those buddy candies in Pokémon Go won’t find themselves), but it still makes her uncomfortable how long I walk. So AITA?Clarification: in light of previous comments, I guess I'll have to divulge some other information, even though I feel I should not divulge such private information online.1. Mom's concern about me walking too much comes from what happened to my brother, who fucked up his knees in cross country back in high school, but the reason he fucked up his knees is because his body doesn't register pain until it's too late and there's irreparable damage.  I, however, can feel everything, to the point that I can't fall asleep if I eat food during the day that my body doesn't like.2. The treadmill is in the garage, nowhere near her bedroom, so the noise is not what upsets her.3. With the exception of the rare occasion when she goes to bed before 12AM in preparation for an early appointment of some sort, I don't disturb her when I wash up in her master bathroom.  She just wants to grant me privacy when I shower there, privacy which seems unnecessary considering she doesn't do that when dad showers.4. I would shower at night in the other bathroom I share with my brother, but my bathroom shares a wall with my brother's bedroom, meaning the sound of that shower disturbs his sleep because he always has to go to bed by 10 due to work starting early the following day.  Also, the shower in my bathroom is more gross.5. Mom thinks I shouldn't exercise more than the recommended amount of time ([150 minutes of moderately intense exercise per week](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/10000-steps/art-20317391)) for fear that I would lose weight when I can't afford to.  But I have to say that my walking has actually increased my appetite, and my weight increased somewhere between 1-3 pounds from my previous baseline when compared to using a stationary bike for an hour.6. Mom's aware I walk so much for Pokémon Go, but that only increases her desire for me to walk less because she thinks playing is a bad influence/addiction in my life, and that I should put that energy instead toward getting work, despite how difficult it's been since college to get ***any*** work in the cut-throat job market I live in.

I live in a converted house, 2 separate upstairs neighbours and I’m the only one with access to the garden (this part will be important). I have 2 children the eldest is at his dads luckily and the youngest is almost 5 months old.So 1 of my neighbours is a bit of a drunk and he can’t handle his drink, he’s also loud and just generally a very inconsiderate person. On New Year’s Eve he got drunk and somehow managed to drop his phone out of his window into my garden (the layout of his property is such that he would have to have his phone propped up against the window for this to happen).

Where I think I may be TA is, I could’ve just gone and got the phone back for him when he first knocked and avoided him terrifying the neighbours, he hasn’t come back and I’m still trying to get the baby back to sleep over an hour after this first started so I haven’t been able to check if my neighbours (rightly) called the police.Edit.

10t1ria,350,"I (28 M) went to school for computer science and work in tech, where I make good money. In 2021, I decided to pursue my passion for writing, and enrolled in an MFA program. Because my house is relatively close to campus and I enjoy entertaining, I started hosting a casual get together for the cohort (it's small, only about ten people) every month or so and it helped us all become closer friends. The parties are nicer than a dorm party (think wine and cheese) but nothing super fancy. In 2022, a new class of students came in and I invited them to the parties as well. One young woman (22ish F) and I got off on the wrong foot. During our first conversation, I mentioned my trip to Vienna last summer and she said ""Ooh, Vienna,"" in a sarcastic tone. Our conversation quickly tapered off after that. I was embarrassed, because I could see how I might have come off as showing off, but I honestly did not mean for it to read that way. Subsequent to that, she has made it pretty clear that she does not like me, and specifically because I have some money. She is always making snide remarks about how exploitative capitalism and rich people and landlords are (she knows I rent a room to another student). As a bit, she once pretended to be a sommelier and sarcastically appraised the wines I had on the table. I understand that not all of her resentment is directed at me, specifically, but it still feels very uncomfortable. She came to the MFA straight from undergrad and leads a 'starving artist' lifestyle, and I am sympathetic to that, but several of the other students share similar circumstances and political views, and I have never felt the same way around them. For the past few parties, I've hoped she would just not come, but she has attended every gathering. I have become a lot more self-conscious about what I wear, what food and drink I serve, and what I say in conversation, and it's honestly just exhausting and not fun to host when she is around. So, I would like to explicitly stop inviting her. It will definitely create a little drama, since everybody else is still invited. Over the past two years, these parties have almost become semi-official events for the students in the program, so it definitely feels strange to exclude exactly one person. I know that it's ultimately my house and my party, so I am perfectly within my rights, but I also realize that I'm coming from a place of privilege, so I wanted a gut-check.

10tux5h,101,"English is not my first language.I come from a old, wealthy family with a military tradition, so a lot of emphasis on a traditional depiction of masculinity, strength, duty, and so on.My dad's the head of said family, and he has two sons-- my brother \[25m\] and I \[24m\]. My dad's path was pretty classic-- university, stint as a military officer, now is mostly semi retired and lives off the money streaming in from inherited properties.Neither of his sons were quite as traditional-- my brother was always too unathletic and lacked toughness, I didn't care about following tradition or the rules. Regardless, I grew up as the 'favorite' child because I was more athletic and bold whereas he was more bookish. My brother cared a lot more about impressing our parents, both out of genuine desire for affection and because he wanted to inherit property, than I did, so he was in a consistent quest to impress our parents: first by getting into Yale, doing a stint in the military, and now attending Yale Law School. For reference, he didn't particularly like the law, but did it as a way to impress our parents.I had gotten into some good schools such as Oxford and Williams, but chose to forgo that by enlisting in the military and becoming my country's equivalent of special forces for a little while. The reasoning behind that is that if I followed my family's path, it would have been easy and boring, and I wanted to put myself in more struggle to truly test myself. Anyhow, I completed a contract doing that, decided doing it long term wasn't for me, and now spend most of my time learning Muay Thai and mountaineering.My parents are intent on giving me the inheritance because they see  me as, despite being wayward, more tough and brave than my brother. All things considered, he's on his way to his second degree, and I have none, and plus he cares a lot more for it, so I'd give the inheritance to my brother, but my parents are steadfast.A little while ago, my brother visited home and remained stubbornly determined to impress our parents. The issue with this was that this obsession is preventing him from living his own life. He's so focused on winning the approval of somebody who's already given up on him that it's preventing him from truly pursuing his own happiness. He's going through law school, which he doesn't enjoy, he served in the military, which he didn't enjoy, and so on. So I told him truthfully that he will never be approved of by our parents, because they made up their minds years ago, and that they also made up their mind to not give him the inheritance years ago. So, since he's a smart guy who regardless of the inheritance has more than enough money to do whatever he wants, he should stop obsessing over a lost cause and do what *he* wants.This caused him to lash out at me and call me TA. I think I'm just being honest in telling him the truth that he needs to hear.Edit: I have defended my brother when he is insulted by my parents.",AITA for telling my brother he should give up on being approved of?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tux5h/aita_for_telling_my_brother_he_should_give_up_on/
10u56yg,17,"Long story short, I have been with my BF for over four years. When he first met me, I couldn’t boil water. Not even a huge exaggeration. He cooked for us for probably our first two years daily, and was so patient and kind with me.I had never wanted to learn how to cook, but I found myself asking him questions, offering to help, etc over the years. We had a big setback when I accidentally caught our whole grill on fire and almost had to shove it into the pool. Whoops.Now onto the conflict. I’ve taken over cooking for us, and from observing and learning, he’s now dubbed me the Grill Queen. I’m generally a better cook now, and it’s probably because I’m anal and do not let my eyes off anything (see grill incident above, I learned my lesson).Tonight for dinner we did super simple seared ahi tuna steaks. My BF got the pan hot, got the oil in, and I put his tuna in. He prefers his more medium rare, so I cook his first as I like mine barely seared. My BF then complained to me for a while about how I didn’t let the pan get hot enough. I know it was fine, especially for his longer cook time.This wasn’t the first instance of me cooking, and him micromanaging. I got frustrated and told him maybe it’s best that he cooks for the next few days as I’m not doing it right. He huffed and puffed, finished cooking his tuna, and told me it was ready for me to sear mine off.I was frustrated, and it was a quiet dinner.I want to ask if I’m the AH because while I have cooked every meal for us for 2+ years, my BF taught me all the basics about cooking and maybe I should have just accepted that the pan wasn’t hot enough.",AITA for stopping cooking dinner?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u56yg/aita_for_stopping_cooking_dinner/

Our group was able to set her up on a number of dates and she always has the same two complaints. We offer advice when she asks but she doesn't take any of it and keeps doing the same thing over and over.Frankly, I think she's being unrealistic with the reasons she's passed up some of the better guys she was set up with. It's been getting tiring hearing the same complaint over and over again when she won't listen to reason.

I told my parents about a month ago that I was getting a new phone number for the phone and to cancel the one they had on their account. Even though we were all fighting, my parents did not have any issues with this. Fast forward to today, the fighting got so bad I told them not to contact me anymore. My dad told me that I need to give him the phone back so they could send it back to cancel the number. We have the same provider, so I had told him that the provider told me that wasn't necessary to cancel the number and there shouldn't be any cancelation fees. My dad then said that I was obligated to return the phone because I was picking and choosing when to be independent. I pay for my apartment, car, car insurance, gas, and paid to set up the new line (which I absolutely should do because I'm an adult lol), so I told him that I would be more than willing to pay for the month of service that he had even though both he and my mom knew I was no longer using the line. I have made payments for the phone in the past to my mom for the line, but my dad said he never got any money from me, which is a lie because I have texts from my mom proving that I was required to pay money to her in the past.

They became friends through church and have a very sister like relationship. My mom loves photography and makeup, and is by no means professional, but she is very good, and did photography shoots for Jane when she graduated high school, her undergrad, and so much more, as well as doing her makeup. Most recently, Jane asked my mom to do her makeup for her wedding, coming up in April. My mom told her that her wedding is really important, and she should probably hire a professional for it, but Jane insisted she do it as it would mean a lot to her. So yesterday my mom did Jane’s makeup for her engagement pictures, and today for her bridal shower, and will be doing it again in April for her wedding. The only dilemma she faces now is if she should be getting her a gift for the wedding, since she has and will continue to do her makeup for free, which professionally done can go into the hundreds, and typically at wedding my moms likes to gifts couples a knife set which is close to $200.

10tlavf,93,"I’m (33f) pregnant with our first child and this pregnancy hasn’t been easy. While pregnant I’ve gotten very sick three times. The first time, my husband didn’t even realize I was sick even though he was lying in bed right next to me playing his game. I was in so much pain and breathing so hard I thought I was doing to die. Husband didn’t notice until I yelled at him about playing his game, really loud, right next to my ear. The second time, it was during Christmas Eve. I felt the same way I felt the first time, but worse. Again, my husband was lying next to me trying to coax me into going to his parents for Christmas Eve. When he realized I physically couldn’t do it, he said he would go to “drop off presents.” Apparently, dropping off presents and celebrating Christmas with his family was more important than taking care of his sick, pregnant wife. After husband and I fought about leaving me home alone to go to his parents house, he decided/felt forced to stay home. During the night husband was upset and angry and stayed in the living room doing his own thing while I lied in bed. I kept telling him I didn’t feel well and I felt the same way I did the first time I got sick but worse. He didn’t do anything. Around 3am I decided to drive myself to the ER because I couldn’t take the pain and my heart was beating out of my chest. I was worried about the baby. Husband asks me, “where are you going at 3am? It’s freezing outside.” I ignored him and got ready to leave to which he said, “fine, go out in the freezing cold. I don’t care!”Side note, we went to his parents house the next day, on Christmas Day. I felt a little better and guilty so I made sure to go. When we got there his mom says to me, “you know, husband’s younger sibling, didn’t go abroad with his girlfriend because he wasted to spend Christmas with the family.” Husband’s mom made me feel like she blaming me for being sick and keeping her son at home with me on Christmas Eve. I was obviously still under the weather so I didn’t have an appetite. Husband’s dad and mom make me feel like I’m being offensive whenever I can’t eat their food. It’s the cherry on top.Now, I’m sick for the third time. This time I had chills and my body was shaking uncontrollably. I couldn’t get warm and I had body ache. Husband helped take care of me and massaged me to help me feel better. This was great. I truly felt taken care of for once. Now, he’s telling me he’s going to his friend’s house because they made plans. AITA for wanting/expecting my husband to stay by my side when I’m sick?Edit: I did communicate to my husband each time I was sick that I felt bad and ill. I mentioned it several times each time I was sick. The first time he replied with “try to get some rest.” Which, is hard to do with a gaming console blaring in my ear. I even asked him to leave the bedroom and go to the living room which he ignored. The second time I told him I felt really bad and afraid something might be wrong. I clearly stated I wanted to go to the ER, three times. Each time husband replied, “are you sure you want to go to the ER?” “Is it that bad?” “Do you want to try giving it some more time? You might feel better and we can go to dinner at my parents house.” After this reply (from 5pm-3am) he didn’t bother even checking in on me and stayed in the living room because he was upset about missing Christmas Eve dinner. My husband did not end up dropping off gifts. After waiting it out I ended up driving myself to the ER because I was over the whole situation and still worried there might be something really wrong. I am a high risk pregnancy which is why I had the talk with my husband about not having kids. I didn’t want to be sick and have it harm the baby during the pregnancy nor me. Husband promised he would “be there for me every time I was sick and he really wanted a child.” ER doctor told me my blood pressure was extremely elevated (201/107 hr 172) and said my symptoms were “pregnancy related,” I had tachycardia, and needed two IV’s of bp medicine and two oral tablets to bring my bp down. He also said I was dehydrated and prescribed me Albuterol because I had trouble breathing and started wheezing. Obgyn told me “it’s not pregnancy related, and it could be an autoimmune disorder but I can’t take most/any medicine because I am pregnant.” Each time I get sick it feels like the flu with upper respiratory/Covid like symptoms. I get extreme body ache, fever, chills, and tachycardia. I cannot move from my bed without help. It generally lasts for 3-4 days. I did not mention having nausea or “average pregnancy related pains.” I do not expect my husband to stay home with me 24/7. I’m the one who usually makes him go out and hang out with friends because he’s a homebody. For the past 6 months I got sick 3 times and only expected him to be home with me those 3 times. I was upset because he placed his priority in going to his parents house for Christmas Eve dinner instead of helping take care of me. He made it very apparent he didn’t care about me feeling better and only cared about going to his parents. He sees his family almost on a biweekly basis.",AITA for wanting and expecting my husband stays by my side when I’m sick?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tlavf/aita_for_wanting_and_expecting_my_husband_stays/
10u9351,33,"I saw a cute guys livestream on TikTok one day, and for fun I commented “it’s my birthday today” when it wasn’t really my birthday. He wished me happy birthday and I decided to tell the truth and say “I’m just kidding, it’s not actually my birthday” and he laughed and jokingly said “that’s messed up, you just lied to me” and I went on about my day. Like a month later I see the same guy on my fyp, and I comment “hey you’re the guy I lied about my birthday to” and he said in a very serious tone “that’s f*** up, like that’s actually really messed up.” it took me by surprise. I thought maybe he just didn’t remember me so I said “no not about my age, I had joked about it being my birthday when it actually wasn’t” and he said “that’s still really f*** up.” I don’t know why but this made me feel so embarrassed. I didn’t know I had done anything wrong, he laughed at the joke the first time. I cried immediately even though it wasn’t a crying matter but for some reason I just felt so ashamed. I didn’t know if the guy was just weird or if I had genuinely said a bad thing so I decided to make the same joke on some other boys livestream. I said it the exact same way. “It’s my birthday today” he said happy birthday, “just kidding it’s not actually my birthday.” And I was really surprised by this other guys reaction. He said “that’s messed up that you just made me say that.” I didn’t know what to say or do. What was so wrong about the joke I made? Was it really that serious? Does it have some other meaning I’m unaware about? Why’d that first guy laugh at first but then decide it was a f*** up joke a month later? I feel like I’m going crazy over this although it’s not a big deal. I just don’t know what I did to warrant that reaction. I get it if it’s not a funny joke, but is it really so bad?EDIT: I stayed up all night thinking about this. I had made a handwritten apology for this guy, typed it out and sent it to him. I have no response yet but I hope he forgives me. I had asked what it was about my joke that could come across as offensive and I wasn’t expecting people to call me a troll, gross, or immature over this. I wanted an explanation, A reason why he found it funny at first and then changed his mind later, because as I said, he did laugh at my joke at first. Which was all the more reason I thought it was funny. I made a cute boy laugh with it and it was a nice moment.When I saw him again, it’s not like a made the same joke to the same guy. All I did was remind him of how I knew him by stating that he was the guy I made the joke to and THATS when he told me I was fucked up. This is where my confusion is and I wanted it to be explained to me because I didn’t understand it and I felt extremely bad and gross and ashamed.And I had already said how ashamed I felt, I really didn’t need to be called gross.  A few people even said I lied for attention but that is NOT true, I didn’t mean it like that, I tried to be funny and make a cute guy laugh, and it worked the first time! I wasn’t trying to be malicious and hurt his feelings, I want people to understand this, I did not want to do that!EDIT 2: so he replied, and he said “lmfao no ur good I was just kidding with you sorry for making you feel bad” so apparently I really WAS just overthinking it and I’m not an asshole 😅",AITA for joking about it being my birthday?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u9351/aita_for_joking_about_it_being_my_birthday/
10snxco,2157," This happened this past weekend. My (M33) wife (F33) and I have a 6 month old kid.  My wife and I planned a date night and we hired our baby sitter we've used half a dozen times.  The baby sitter (F20) is a college student that lived in our neighborhood and came recommended by some friends that had kids.  She came over to our house, we told her our sons schedule, then headed out.  We were going to go out for dinner and then meet up with friends for drinks.  We have 2 cameras in our house that we can access remotely to check in on our son.  One is over his bed and the other is over his play area in the living room.  The babysitter knows about both cameras, so it isn't like we were spying on her.  My wife gets a notification that there is motion in the play area, she pulls it up to check in.  She sees a dog sniffing our son.  We are both like WTF.  We don't own any dogs and have no plans to ever own any dogs.  We try calling, no answer, so we rush home.  We go inside and the baby sitter is holding our son and there is a golden retriever just hanging out.  Everyone is calm and fine.The babysitter seems shocked we are already home.  I ask the babysitter why there is a dog in our house.  She says its her golden retriever and decided to bring it today.  The babysitter assures us the dog is baby and kid friendly and is sweet and safe.   I don't want my son around dogs at such a young age even if they are ""sweet"" and ""safe"".I'm getting more and more angry. This was not something she was transparent about and if we knew the dog was going to be there, I would have never okayed it.  I just firmly tell her to grab her dog and please leave.  I inform her we won't be using her in the future and pay her half her rate we had agreed upon, mostly since we used her less than half the time we were going to be out. She asks for the full amount.

Fast forward a few weeks, my mom comes into my room and asks if I can let her use my new coat. I instantly said no because she has a canada goose and a few other coats, but she started calling me selfish. I have never worn it and in my opinion, being the first to wear something you bought or a gift you got is a part of the experience.

Long story short, she now owns the coat and I have my old coat with some minor holes in it.   Besides the length of the coat, she also used the price as a excuse.

He agreed and said that there will be no need for a direct deposit and asked me to go ahead and make the account online. I was busy at the time so I didn't do it at that moment.Today after work I decided to make the joint account since I get paid soon. My bf then told me to wait and he would send me a referral link. I then repeated that I wasn't doing any direct deposit so we wouldn't get any benefit from the referral and that I could just go ahead and make the account. He then told me that I should go to my employer and have my paycheck split between the two bank accounts so we can get the direct deposit benefits. I told him I didn't want to do that, I wanted my paycheck to go to my personal bank account and I can divide my money from there and send it to the joint account.He then got angry and told me that he doesn't understand why now all of a sudden I am against the direct deposit. I told him that I had said before that I was against it on numerous occasions. I specified that days ago when he brought up the idea, I said I wasn't going to do a direct deposit. He said he told me numerous times about the benefits of doing the direct deposit and I never brought it up then, but I have. Plenty of times. I explained to him that I would just feel more comfortable and more in control of my money if I have it all going to my personal account first. Especially since his side of the bill money for rent this month disappeared and I had to cover it. He told me that I was lying and that I didn't have to cover his rent. But I did. I told him that originally he told me that not doing direct deposit was fine and the account was just going to be for bills. But suddenly it's a big deal and it's also supposed to be a joint savings account as well as being for bills. He called me crazy for not caring about the benefits of doing a direct deposit in the joint account. I told him I didn't care and just want to have control of my money in case something happens.To his defense he specified that he also would split his paycheck between his personal account and the joint account. The direct deposit benefits are an extra $50 a month and 8% APY.

She was going to a store where I needed to pick up some cool markers and I gave her what I thought was more than enough for the purchase, but came up a little short. We were out shopping today and she found something that was $8.00 and proposed I buy it and we split it to wipe away the debt. No problem. When I got to the register the cashier seemingly forgot to charge me for it (I bought a lot of other random things too, and it's a big closeout store and things are very jumbled). We were too far away by the time we realized the mistake and the store is very far from where we live.I was content to go through with the original arrangement, but my mom feels that I am in the wrong as I accidentally got the item for free and still owe her $3.99. I contend that I would have (and thought I did) pay full price for the item and had the mistake not been made it is still worth $4.00.

He treats me amazingly and gets along super well w my friend group who are for the most part women and gay guys, he genuinely likes them and even hangs out w them when I’m not there. However, lately he’s been calling me out for acting “fake” and not being myself around them. For context, me and him have both made fun of “tik tok language” before and have kind of a running joke about it, sarcastically saying stuff like “not me doing _____” “slay” “it’s giving ____” “you ate and left no crumbs” using sparkle emojis, etc (No hate to people who use this lingo lol, we personally j have a joke about it and would never make fun of anyone who says that stuff). I don’t ever say these expressions w my friends and neither do they, but he says the way I talk around them is similar to the stuff we laugh about when it’s just us two. I agree that I have a more “feminine” affect and maybe use different tone than I would use with him (calling them “girl,” using a higher voice pitch, don’t really know how to describe the rest of it other than the way I talk is kinda different) but this is 100% unintentional and natural to me. He’s very unapologetically himself in all scenarios which I and everyone else love about him, but from his pov he thinks that I’m trying to be someone I’m not to fit in with them, and that I don’t talk like this around him, other straight guys, or even my girl/gay friends from home (we’re at college). I think he’s being harsh about it, saying I’m “fake” and “he doesn’t even know who I am.” I argue that this is totally unintentional and obviously I’m gonna talk to my female/gay friends in a slightly different syntax than to people of other demographics, and that im just a Gemini moon (lol) and the type of person that subconsciously adapts to the vibe of whatever group I happen to be in, and it never goes as far as changing my personality or doing or agreeing to things I wouldn’t otherwise.

I wasn't too keen on making changes to the race. and had inquired if I could take a hiatus from the group and come back for the next campaign since I spotted a race, I really liked that would work in that one.  I was told that since it was a paid group and not a friend's group that wasn't possible as slots are first come first serve. This was when I decided that it would be better for me to leave since I wasn't wanting to pay to play a character I may not enjoy. Fast forward hours later when I ask if he would be interested in joining one of my free games (I'm trying to learn to DM and thought he would be willing to help me out). This greatly offended him as he believed I ""screwed him over"" and am ""messing with his future"" by leaving his group when he could have made changes so I didn't have to leave, so how dare I ask if he would join mine. Because if he can't pay for his college classes he will be kicked out and become homeless.  I sympathize with his situation and understand how serious it is; however, I've paid him 100s of dollars through his other buisnesses. I did this as a friend wanting to help out a friend.

10tyke2,10,"I (21 F)Have had a rocky relationship with my fathers side of the family and this situation might have made it worse.Last week my father and I had a conversation. He started talking about how he wanted to have another child because me and my siblings do not really like him. He said that having another child he could do right by them. I flat out told him that taking care of a child is not as easy as it seems. It's not just about sending them money. (he never changed my diapers as a kid because he doesnt change girls) He needed to change their diaper, dress them, take them to appointments, take them to school, mold them into proper functioning people. The conversation was left sour.Well, a few weeks ago my father sent me a text message after trying to call. I ignored the call. He asked if i remembered when I was younger when I told him I could have a younger sister. I vaugly remembered him telling me this after telling me of his various flings. She said he wasn't the father and he moved on with his life. Well, the woman he slept with contacted him and told him he is infact the father of the child. My father was estatic. I simply said that he should get a DNA test to be sure. He then sent me a picture of the girl, saying that she looks just like me. i have to admit, there were small features, but again, i rheitorated that he needed to get a DNA test just to be sure. A few days later, he sent me pictures of him meeting the girl! Talking about how he was going to spoil and treasure her after finding his new daughter. This pissed me off. My father calls me all the time complaining about how child support is taking so much of his money away. This infuriated me beyond belief. My aunt says its because I used to be his favorite but thats far from the truth. My grandmother visited her, she called me saying that that girl is her grandbaby and she acts just like me. She says she likes to draw, watch anime, smiles, talks, and looks like me.She said that althought the girl is in the system, she has a support system now. I always watned to scream. These people that completely abandonded me in foster care are going to help her! My grandmother started talking about me to the girl and said I was excited to meet her. I again said you should get a DNA test just to be sure!Why put this girl through this thinking she may have another family and it turns out we are not her paternal family. My grandmother said I should see her and I declined. I said, ""I am not going to speak with her until I know for sure she is my sister, and even if she was my sister, why is that my responsibility to form a relationship with her when I don't have a relationship with my other siblings because of my fathers lack of control?""

He works pretty hard so I do most of the housework.  It is just the two of us.   I work part time at a kebab place.  And sometimes I bring home kebabs for us from work.  One set for me and one for him.  I always get the garlic cilantro sauce on the side because my dad can't eat it.  So a few weeks ago I did exactly that. I wasn't hungry so I left them all in the fridge.  When I got up to get my food they were all gone.  He had eaten everything.   So now I make sure my kebabs are soaked in the cilantro sauce.  And he can only eat his.   I buy myself snacks that I like and I found that they were disappearing from the pantry.   My dad pays for all the household food so I asked him if I could use the grocery budget to pick up those snacks since he obviously likes them.  He said no.  So now I am shopping carefully and only buying snacks that have ingredients he cannot eat.   He has a soy allergy.  I make sure that I'll my stuff with soy is well labelled and I keep it simple in my room away from the other food.  I also picked up extra spicy snacks that he cannot handle.  He noticed that I wasn't keeping my stuff in the pantry any more.  He said I had to share.  So I showed him the ingredients on my stuff.  And I let him try my mildest spicy snack.  He drank about a quart of milk. He says that he works hard to provide and he deserves snacks.  I agree.  I've even bought him some he likes.  And if he didn't eat them all in one go they would last between grocery trips.  My older sister called me and said I needed to smarten up. She says he feels like I'm picking on him.  I'm not.

10tlwii,114,Hi I recently rescued a stray and although it’s only been a few weeks I’ve become really attached to this pet. My partner however does not agree with me keeping it. We have gotten into arguments about it with them feeling as though I never take into consideration their opinion in anything and that I am not responsible enough. I tried to come to a middle ground were we could see how it goes with the pet just so they could see that I am responsible enough to take care of it. They didn’t like this agreement and told me it was best to give it away. I was sobbing over the thought of giving it away because I really enjoy having it around. This pet is so sweet they wake me up in the morning with lots of cuddles and all of their quirks that I’ve come to enjoy. Today we get into another argument on the phone in which they told me that I was very irresponsible and always got things my way. I asked for some examples but they said there were too many to list but that me getting a piercing was one of them. I don’t know how to feel or do. I don’t want any more arguments within this relationship but I also can’t imagine giving away my pet.

10sorq8,2588,"I’m early 20sF and last year started working at a major company. I entered this job through a scheme for disadvantaged young people. Despite this, the interview process was still incredibly tough and I’m proud to have made it this far. When I’m not with my team I hang out with the other girls I’ve met and befriended through that scheme. The nephew of the CEO started his role at our department a little later and for whatever reason has been joining us girls for lunches etc. He tries VERY HARD to fit in and acts like he doesn’t come from a place of insane privilege. He will literally pretend to be humble and downplay his family’s wealth just to seem relatable I guess. The others have been warming up to him but I’m honestly not buying his rather fake personality. The other day I was sitting at the canteen with another coworker and he asked if he could join us. I didn’t want that but my coworker immediately said yes. Well he was asking me lots of personal questions and about my journey to the company. I told him that the interview process was hard and mentally draining. He nodded and said that it’s tough getting into the place but that his interviews were “fine”. Even laughing and saying he came late to one because of a hungover. This made me mad and I said “good for you”. He thanked me and said that things always work out when you just “chill out” and stop taking things so seriously. This is when I said that we both know he’s not nearly as competent as he believes and that he only got the job bc his uncle is literally the CEO. My friend/coworker gasped and looked at me like I’m crazy. The nephew shrugged and said that I don’t seem to like him. I told him that this wasn’t a personal matter so likes and dislikes are irrelevant. We didn’t argue but he got a little heated. And asking me what I want him to do. Then he said that I may view him as an over privileged asshole but I’m more or less the same (which makes no sense). So I fully expected him to report me to HR but to my surprise he never did. In fact he started following me on my social media accounts and messaging me at work more frequently. My coworker has relayed this incident to the other girls and the consensus is that I’m a major asshole.

That was actually how we met- but that’s another story for another time- Susie and I stick together for most of the party, and for a while we don’t see Monica anywhere, so we both decided to go to another place that was quieter. That was when we finally found Monica. She was fooling around with people and were about to do something ridiculous, so me and Susie were quick to pull her out of there. We dragged her to her room where me and Susie told her off on being more careful, but monica (unfortunately) brings up Susie’s past mistakes, which leads both of them into a fight. I tried to stop them which leads to monica calling me names and telling me that I ruined the “good” party. I tried not to get upset by this but she kept on going on about being naïve, or friendly towards strangers, to which Susie then tries to defend me, and the cycle starts up again until me and susie both walk out upset about everything.

I'm sure this is jealousy, so this is why I'm asking here - But I know that she is loaded. Like over thousands of dollars a month from art projects, gallery commissions, etc. So is her partner.I would actively go to her art things - Because I always have. I noticed over the years even when I messaged her in advance to hopefully get her support in something of mine (emotional support, or support for stuff I happen to like as well), at the last minute she's busy with a ""last minute flight with her partner's family"" or she has an art thing, which I understand. It's just been harder to message her knowing that she will most likely not make a certain thing.

I have 24-hour shifts every other day, and I get to go on 72-hour shifts at the hospital with only a few hours of sleep 4 times a month.I have been dating my girlfriend (23F) for two years. Her parents and brother (29) live in a different city. They were going to come visit us for a few days. My girlfriend had told me that beforehand. She obviously knows my schedule. I offered to help her before her parents got here, I only managed to get a few items, gifts, etc. Later she told me to carry on with my routine and said she'd handle the hosting duties. I had one of those 72-hour nightmare shifts, we had countless admissions, and only got to sleep very occasionally. It is safe to say I was almost a zombie by the time I got home.After I got home, took a shower and told my girlfriend I was going to sleep a little bit. I set an alarm to get up and help my GF in the kitchen, watch a movie or something. I slept through the whole day and got up around 10PM. When I went downstairs, I saw my GFs parents and her brother. I had completely forgotten about my GF's family coming over later that day. They had a very unimpressed look. My girlfriend's mother told me it was extremely disrespectful of me to not be there to welcome them the first time they were coming over to visit. I got similar comments from all of them. (My GF said she purposefully didn't wake me up because I was going to go back to the hospital in a few hours and I needed my sleep. Her family didn't change their minds.)Her brother later told me (privately) that I was neglecting my girlfriend and being selfish in this relationship. He said his sister deserved much better than someone who wouldn't even acknowledge her family.I feel horribly about all this. I asked a few friends but they're all terrible when it comes to these kinds of advice. I honestly don't know.  AITA?Edit:  I was allowed to leave the hospital around 2 PM, got home around 3 PM, took a shower and went to sleep at 3.30, I set an alarm for 6 PM but slept through it.

My boyfriend still lives with his parents so i always felt grateful to be there.After a while living in their home, some months passed by, their house was robbed. Even though i was innocent and had nothing to prove otherwise, his mother started to think it was my fault, I was already expecting that it would happen because of course I’d be the first suspect, I was living there for not a long time.She began to act cold and my boyfriend had to go through my phone just to be sure I didn’t had nothing that could go against me.She was obviously trying to sabotage my relationship with his son.For a year I felt like I was an imposter in their life, like no one wanted me there. I cried and cried everyday because I just wanted to go home but my boyfriend asked me to stay. A year or so had passed, we moved to another city.She no longer thinks I was the responsible for the robbery, at least I think so, but I can’t feel comfortable around her anymore.

10tt7mx,40,"So I'm 15, and I was given a phone for free. The only cost to my mom in this scenario is any startup fees and a protective screen. It's not even a deal that was worked out, it's no strings attached. I was given the phone today. My uncle had me texting my mom through his phone (I type quicker and he generally dislikes typing), and had me tell her I got the phone. She asked what it was, and was upset when being told it is a Samsung A11. Me nor my uncle had any say what phone I got, but I'm admittedly glad it is. To quote her, she's upset because, ""harder to spy on her shit with that one"". I was upset, because she treats me like I'm irresponsible. I was when she last trusted me with my own device, at 10 and unsupervised, but I'm 15 now, and she will admit herself I'm more mature. Well, she called to discuss expectations with me. Some of them I understand, but there's also some that I think are ridiculous. For example; No texting anyone but her and my uncle. This stuck out to me, because she knows I have friends and a boyfriend. Well I asked her about it, because I want to be able to talk to my friends outside of just school, which would mean texting. And I mentioned I saw the text about spying and was confused about what she meant. I understand going through it if I get in trouble, but she phrased it as more than that. Well, she meant weekly checking everything. Down to my contacts list to make sure it isn't anyone she doesn't want me talking to. I brought up that I didn't like that, because it just makes me feel creeped out. I already know privacy is lacking in this house, but it seems more like stalking than doing anything for my own safety.

I think she resented me for still working there even though I ended up getting fired a month later for unrelated reasons.Recently A introduced me to Taylor and tells me that they're best friends. also end up meeting Taylor's bf, Gabe. G is a very blunt guy, but still super nice to people. When we met I found out that they don't own a car and told them both that if they ever needed a ride anywhere I'd be more than happy to help(I've told A something similar even though she has her own car).After we all hung out, A created a gc with all of us. T ended up going to jail and G started texting the gc often about how much he missed her and all the letters he's sending her (I found out he doesn't talk to people outside of T and his family). G loves art and constantly sent pics of his work to the gc. A sent a pic of her drawing and G told her it was great but she could probably do more work on the legs. A blew up on him for that, and he ended up leaving the gc because of it. After he left the gc, I texted him and basically said that she was wrong for what she did and that if he ever needed anything I'd be thereThe 1st time G asked for a ride (a few days before the argument) A found out and ended up coming along even though none of us invited her, I found out after this that G didn't feel comfortable around A. That A and T weren't really as close as A made it seem and that T noticed that A only really comments or swipes on posts if G is in them. Both T and G said they don't really like when G is with A cause it makes them uncomfortable even though she has a bf.G asked if I could drive him to visit T, I agreed (this isn't the first time I've driven him somewhere) and omw to pick him up I get a call from A asking where I'm at, I say I'm going to hangout with a friend. A says that G texted her cause he wanted to know how far away I was.

10txq0i,74,"So it's my (32f) and BFs (31m) first anniversary tomorrow (been friends for over 10 years).  We went to a gokart place he wanted to about 90 mins away, then 30 mins from that (closer to home) we went to a sculpture place.  Leaving the gokart place on the way to the sculpture place we got in a small...disagreement.  it wasn't completely an argument but basically he said that I follow too many rules (I dont) and that he's not going to let me prevent him from doing what he wants.  I think I break rules when it makes sense and I think he makes things stressful by seemingly NEVER following rules.  For instance, we went on vacation about 4 months into our relationship and went kayaking.  They told us to wear our life vests.  He was a swimmer and lifeguard so he didn't want put it on, and I'm like dude just do it.  But it's uncomfortable for him.  So he puts it on and doesn't buckle.  Then at one point during the tour we were near an oyster farm and they said to not get close as to not disturb the oysters.  Well he's paddling closer to see something about the dock and I'm paddling away (in the same kayak) and he starts getting snippy with me being like wtf are you doing?? And I'm like ?? Wtf are YOU doing??  (He swears we weren't that close but it was shallow and I can't see the bottom of the kayak to know how far or close we were to them, it wasn't more the 6 inches).It's just small things like that.  I follow the rules when I think they make sense OR when breaking the rules causes too much of a headache.  He said that I have too much anxiety from my mom (I do) but generally, I know when my anxiety is irrational, like how terrified I am about airplanes.Anyway, we go to the sculpture place that's outside, so they're big and secured to withstand weather.  But right off the bat he walks right up to one and starts touching it and gently knocking on it to see the material, cuz he's very very curious about things, too.  I moved on but I was like wow, already?  So we move on and later he starts walking up to one that had a camera point right at it and I'm like can you stop, there is a camera RIGHT there. And he was like WHAT? And I was like you're too close, and he's like are you fking kidding me? I didn't do anything wrong, I didn't touch it.  And I was like well I thought you might cuz you already did, you're just not supposed to get that close, it's disrespectful.  He tried to argue and I just continued the rest of the way since it was towards the end.Now we're having a tense and silent ride home.  I feel like I'm right and it's respectful to stand back from people's art, but maybe I shouldn't have policed him, plus there weren't signs that said do not touch so maybe since they're secure and durable it's okay to touch them (there was a sign at the beginning saying don't climb on things or pick flowers).ETA I know he sounds like a terrible person, but these all stem from him thinking he knows better.  He wouldn't have touched anything of someone else's if he feels he can do harm.  He's turned down using things of others unless he feels like he's 100% sure he won't harm it.  He bends the rules when he genuinely thinks he's doing no harm OR when the harm is only towards himself, hence the lifejacket argument.  He understands lifejackets and fully supports me wearing one, but also would trust me if I said I didn't need it and wants me to trust that he knows his own capabilities.I do trust his capabilities, but IMO just because you *can* touch something without doing damage doesn't mean you *should* out of respect.

10tzk5y,12,"My boyfriend (now ex) (28M) and I (23F) were together for three years. Our sex life wasn’t great anymore and the contributing element was that he was almost 30, without a degree or a job, living in his mom’s basement. He kept promising he was going to do great things, and I stayed for three years supporting him and believing him whenever he would say he was going to “change the world one day”.Truth was, he was a pathological liar, a WoW addict, smoked weed every morning, and would leave the house for 10+ hours at a time lying about being in college (he dropped out in secret) or at work (he would constantly get fired) while he was buying other sorts of drugs and hanging out with strangers met on Reddit.Because of that, we decided to open our relationship and the only rule was to disclose everything with one another, also we were not allowed to flirt with family members and friends. Of course that was the first thing he did, starting with my sister (19F) and most of my female friends. Followed by 16 other girls and OnlyFans subscriptions.One of my friends, I’ll call her G (21F) which I didn’t know that well at the time, called me one day, telling me that he lied about not being in open relationship so she would make out with him. She said during the call that the only reason she went along with him was because she was tired of being a virgin and was basically going after every person she knew to have her first experiences with. After that event I helped her feel less anxious and convinced her to take her time and search for someone she loved instead.Forward almost a year later, I am now with my new amazing boyfriend and his family at a gathering, and G is there with us. My boyfriend’s mom then asked how we became friends, and I explained that we bonded over my ex cheating on me with her. Everybody became interested in the story, so I started talking about all the narcissistic and horrible things my ex did, how he wasted three years of my life and lied to all his family and friends about making so much money and how each day it was a brand new lie.That’s when I said I was glad that G called me and basically saved me from that horrible situation. She replied saying it kinda sucks though that the most experience she’s ever had was with him, and I said “Oh but you were desperate at the time, you have so much higher standards now”.She later told me in private that she felt disrespected by me calling her “desperate” in front of my boyfriend’s mom. I tried explaining that I was trying to do the exact opposite and give reasoning to why she would ever go for someone like him, and I even told her that I was probably very desperate myself to even give that relationship so many chances even after all the cheating and lying.I don’t think my explanation helped and she just said it was ok, but I still feel like I did something wrongSo AITA for calling my friend “desperate”?",AITA for calling my friend “desperate”,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tzk5y/aita_for_calling_my_friend_desperate/

My phone rang and it was as my brother, he said she had passed out the toilets in town and she was on the way to the hospital. I’ll never forget when he said “she’s not looking good, I don’t know think she’s going to wake up”. I was so confused and worried. I got to the hospital and they said they were doing tests and scans but eventually they told us she had a bleed on the brain, a stroke which left her paralysed on her left side and she had fallen into a coma. I sat by her bedside for 4 days just talking to her, holding her hand and just begging her not to leave me. They eventually told us they were taking her off life support. I regret that I didn’t tell her everything I wanted to. I hate myself for not saying more. Not doing more. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find anyone to look after my son so I had to go home and that night at 12:32am she passed away alone bcos none of my siblings wanted to stay. After she passed I had to tell everyone, arrange her funeral and collect her ashes and I had to empty out her house and sort her finances. I asked everyone to help me and they all said no. My brother said “you didn’t bother staying with her the night she passed so why you bothering with all this?”. It really upset me bcos I really wanted to be there but without a babysitter, I physically couldn’t. He could have but all he cared about was her money which he took before she had even passed.

The weird thing is that when I need help, I ask for it. But nobody ever asks me for help. They always talk to my mom and then she ends up telling me and making the arrangements.  A couple times, she’s let me know that my brother is going to need my help with something, but then he makes other arrangements.

She is a vegan, which is fine but she is very judgemental to how I live. She doesn’t agree with cancer scans (like smear tests, mammograms etc) because vegans “don’t get cancer”, when I had my daughter she said I should be feeding her almond milk. She once came to my house for dinner and I cooked a chicken for me and my family and a nut roast for my father and her. She later dug a hole in my garden to give the chicken bones a proper funeral because she was so “heartbroken to see us eating it’s blood and flesh”.I wish I was joking.  She has also accused me of trying to steal her fathers house. I have never met her father, I have never set foot in her fathers house. All I know is he died recently. I had communicated some cost of living worries to my dad (not asking for money) and she ran with it and said I was trying to manipulate her into giving me her inheritance. I do not want her inheritance. Long story short, my father will only pay for my wedding if it’s vegan.

I don’t want to be controlled over what I can and can’t do on my wedding day, I’m sick of her judgement (and his, now she’s gotten her claws into him) and I just think it will be better for me, my siblings and my mother if they do not come.

Also if I’m supposed to be in another subreddit for updating, lmk as well!)So, my post here got a bunch of attention! I was suprised to see so many people reach out and even more shocked to see parents share their insight. I don’t know why that suprised me the most-I suppose I’ve only had my parents, so hearing from parents that don’t struggle with the same bigotry mine do was a bit surprising.My sister was born two weeks ago, with a few minor complications but she’s alive and healthy. They kept my deadname as her name. I heard about this from my brother-I have cut off both my parents.  a lot of commenters brought up how she’d feel growing up knowing her eldest brother didn’t want a relationship with her, and I genuinely hadn’t considered that. I know this part is gonna be controversial, but I’ve decided with my brothers that as long as my parents don’t say anything, no one will bring me up unless she asks. If she does, I’m away for college and planning on moving to another state when i graduate, so we wouldn’t have that close of a relationship anyways, i think. When she gets older i think i’ll try to have a relationship if she’s willing to. and is willing not to go by my deadname. her situation sucks but that’s the name she’s gonna be called by most now, and i don‘t want to force her to not use it when she’s gonna grow familiar with that name. But i can’t be around it either, knowing the intent behind it.My brothers have decided to call her a name completely unrelated to my deadname, no matter how much my parents insist they call her by it. They’ve also taken to calling my mom by my grandmas (her mother in laws) name, which she absolutely hates, so that made me giggle a bit.All iin all, things aren’t really okay, but I’m managing and I’m at peace with things for now. I’m no longer angry, i think. I just worry for my sister, how confusing it will be for her. What my parents did wasn’t fair to me but even worse, it was horrible on her.I’m sorry, I’m sure you guys wanted a happier ending or a more firm resolution but this is how things are right now, and unfortunately I don’t think it will change, not for a few years at least. A few people asked for an update, and i didn’t want to leave them hanging after helping me.Thanks for reading.

I was super happy for him and we started talking about how they met, for how long they know each other and what she's like. The usual stuff. About 15 minutes into the conversation, I asked him if he could show me a picture of her. He refused, saying he doesn't have one yet and her only publicly available picture (whatsapp) is blurry and old. He also was angry at me for asking to see a picture of her, because ""looks don't matter and that's not the third or fourth question to ask a friend about their new partner"".I guess his implication was that my question was shallow and superficial, but honestly I don't think that asking to see how my friend's new GF looks is an ill-intended question.So, was he right and that question was indeed inappropriate?",AITA for asking my friend to show a picture of his new GF?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u003t/aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_show_a_picture_of/
10tllh3,12,"My roommate has become increasingly rude and passive aggressive when she doesn’t like something over the last six months. She’s been creating an incredibly negative energy in our apartment. All of us say things like “hey, I’m sorry but..” and say “please” when we ask for things but she just demands and acts demeaning toward everyone in the group chat.  We had a meeting with all four of us to discuss expectations, as we all had something we wanted to discuss (like drying dishes, not overloading trash can, ext.) and at the end I said that we should be respectful of one another and especially not swear at one another when making requests or when we notice something we don’t like. I stated we all get angry and frustrated sometimes but we need to be respectful regardless. She started to lose her temper and rant about everything she doesn’t like and began blaming me for a variety of things. We all just awkwardly ended the meeting and went to our rooms after that. This is partially on me but I shut down when people lose their tempers. I know this comes from living w an abusive ex but I just have very little trust with temperamental people. I texted in the morning saying she was really aggressive when I literally tried to ask her to be less aggressive. Then I stated that we all do things wrong (and pointed out some times she did things that none of us over reacted/ got angry about). I told her I would not be speaking to her without an RA present (we’re in college) because I am uncomfortable with how she has been communicating with others. She began acting like you can literally talk to me and I said if you don’t see an issue with how you acted then I don’t see a solution. She responded by laughing at the message and then I blocked her. I know it’s childish but she genuinely gives me anxiety. If she had apologized or at least said she understands where she went wrong I would have talked to her but she just blows up and rants at people. When I tried to calmly talk to her during the meeting she freaked out. Then we made a meeting with the RA and she didn’t show up (disrespecting my time and the RAs.)

10ttuos,43,UPDATE: I've responded that there should be been a discussion first before assuming others will spend large amounts of money but the responsibility falls to the landlord so I won't be paying. Will leave it between her and him to discuss. Thanks!EDIT: the landlord is the other flatmate and another owner currently living overseas. We are based in New Zealand. Historically if someone has ever found an insect inside it hasn't been a big deal and weve never had infestations.My (F25) flatmate (F30) found a small cockroach about 1 cm in her room two days ago. Me and the other flatmate went away that day and came back yesterday to find a series of long messages telling us she had bought $60 worth of bug spray and an exterminator was coming for $180 during the week (she charged these amounts so they were split between the three of us) and that we need to take it seriously and evacuate the house. This was done without consulting either of us.I'm a recent graduate and have a really low income compared to her. I don't believe finding a single insect necessarily means there is an infestation and responded to her series of messages saying I don't have the money to fork out for it and don't necessarily believe it is necessary. She's angry and saying it's a health hazard and I have to.AITA for not paying?TLDR; flatmate found a small cockroach and  is forcing my flatmate and I to pay for assortments of bug spray and an exterminator for $80 each without consulting us.

He doesn't want to just ask me questions, or run his solutions by me, he wants my work, and he wants all of it.

I started college when I was 17 and in my country it's nearly impossible to get a job if you're under 18, you also can't have a bank account if you're minor. I didn't have any allowence or has any pocket money so i couldn't afford anything by myself. The only thing was a scholarship so college was free for me and sometimes i would have some money on top, but the only things i could afford where books or materials for college.During my time on college i saved some money from some side gigs and after graduating i was able to find a job in my industry. I was accepted for a masters degree in another country, so i moved out and I'm living there from my savings and what i earn part time.Before my mom never helped me financially, but bought plane tickets for me, because my initial flight was cancelled due to covid and I could get my money back. The only things she would provide was sometimes food and I was allowed to leave at her home. I never even had a room, i just always slept on the couch. There was a few times where i lived on campus because it was better than that.My mom is an addict and she lives her life to the fullest, she always buys what she wants, goes on party's and goes on vacation 2-3 times a year. I or my brother never where abroad or on a vacation, she just waited until we were old enough to let us alone and since then she travels a lot. She also picked up a few expensive hobbies.When she figured out i have saved up some money she demanded me to gift it to her. She also said something upon the lines that if i would work more, would sell all what i own, that then i could take a mortgage to buy a bigger house for her. No idea how i was supposed to do that all i had was 3-4k, while a tiny shitty studio costs 50.000.000 in my area.My mom also was never supportive of me or my career choices.

Our original date was 21SEP24 but due to a lot of competition from other brides at our chosen venue we are on the waitlist for 14SEP24 instead. I had originally given the 21st as the date when asking my bridesmaids but told them nothing is set in stone until the venue accepts us. I have been communicating with them via group chat whenever something changes and when I posted the new date I got a private text from lizzie (27f) (not Real Name) saying she could no longer be in my party unless I changed the date.

I was confused but accepted her backing out because I had no interest in trying to find a new date. This was in January and It wasn’t mentioned again until this Last week when a mutual coworker made a comment about the Date and how it was really weird that I am “stealing” her day and theme.

10tffrb,30,"I (24F) live with my mom (50sF) and younger sister (19F). In my country, it's traditional that you live with your parents until you get married and move out with your partner. I WFH rotational shifts. I usually prefer to work at night starting 6 PM, or graveyard shift starting 10 PM. After I finish my nine-hour shift, I always do the dishes, tidy up, put laundry in wardrobe if there's any, sweep, take out trash. My mom is SAHM and does the grocery shopping &amp; cooking. My younger sister is in college and only does chores during winter/ summer breaks. My work is basically customer experience chat support. It gets overwhelming during rush hours and sometimes I can't even move from one chair to another because I'm so focused and don't have the time to move.The issue here is that my mom absolutely berates me if I don't do chores WHILE working. I can be in the middle of rush time, finally have my 15-minute break, and she starts yelling about chores not being done. I tell her that I'm exhausted from work, and will get it done after I finish my shift. She argues that I'm just chilling in my break and if I have time to ""chill"" I can do chores. Sometimes, it's true. On rare occasions, I manage to sneak in chores during my work break or during work itself if I don't have any active chats or tasks.Just now we've had an argument.

I got hungry while working so during my 15-minute break I made an egg, and another for my sister cause she requested one too. I left the pan in the sink cause my break time was already over before I even managed to eat and thought I'd do the dishes later during my longer 30-minute break. Mom woke up and was absolutely livid when she saw the pan in the sink. I calmly explained that I didn't have time and I intended to get it done; it just had to wait for an hour. She kept yelling at me so I told her to save her yelling to the person who stacked up the dishes yesterday. She said it was herself but ""how dare"" I not clean up the mess. Again, I explained that I ran out of break time, am currently working, would get it done in an hour's time. She kept yelling at me so I quite frankly lost my shit and yelled back saying she had no understanding or empathy for me and shouldn't direct her anger at me everytime she was pissed (a habit of hers). She said I was the one with no empathy cause she was old and needed help around the house.Fyi, mom receives monthly pension for my late father &amp; grandparents so rent &amp; utilities are covered by this passive income.

10tw8uz,25,"I'm going to preface this with some background information. I do not live with the mother, she is several states away and the child was the result of a summer fling during extended work travel. We were using birth control at the time but the child looked nothing like her ex. At about 7 months I questioned her on it and she reassured me I wasn't the father. But at about 1.5 years we started talking again and after some testing of both me and the ex, I was the father.During our first conversations when my fatherhood was established. I said I wanted to be in the child's life. She wanted the same because I guess her and the ex relationship went south quickly (it was before the child's paternity came in question). So I asked what exactly she was going to do with that situation because he was crushed by the news. She said she was going to let him see him occasionally and hoped he got over it eventually long term and moved on. I told her I understand this was a difficult situation and there's no real winners but I didn't think long term that was a healthy situation for the child, myself, her, or the ex. She agreed.She also wanted to attempt a relationship. So far that hasn't gone well but nevertheless, about 2 months into this I got some strange texts from her. Turns out it was the ex reading through our phone messages and texting me about wanting me out of her life, loving the ex, etc.. I questioned her on this and she said she was surprised but sort of brushed it off. I said she needed to make a decision on this and rip the bandaid off. This situation is going to get 10x worse the longer it lingers. She said she knows.Fast forward to recently when I recently tried to call my child for facetime and I find out he's not with her, but with her ex who is watching him. This absolutely floored me and I kind of exploded calling her a coward and asking what in the fuck is she thinking. I told her if she wants to be with her ex, fine, but I am absolutely not letting my child grow up with two fathers. She started to blame me for not being around (I have 90% work travel, she knew this before wanting to do this. And I put in effort to see them. We spent the holidays together meeting each other's families. I fly to them or vice versa. I'll go them on weekends, etc). I honestly don't think that's even relevant but basically she's trying to flip this on me now for getting angry about it and not ""supporting enough."" I told her I think she has extreme avoidance issues and is afraid to deal with conflicts or problems.Look, I understand our relationship is a bit messed up. Nothing can really be done about how things happened at this point. But am I wrong to think this situation with the ex is completely messed up? Most importantly for my son.

He did not respond, and he purposefully avoided giving me a yes or no when I asked him in person. Time was running up, and I made the executive decision to say yes. He had said yes to her spending the night back in December, but plans fell through, and it didn't end up happening. When I told him that she was going to stay with my aunt and grandma, he got so angry with me and asked me why I would say yes to something like that. I told him that I asked him for his opinion, and he refused to give me an answer. He told me that he knew about his feelings towards my aunt and that our daughter was not allowed to be around her.Basically, my husband doesn't like my aunt because of her personality. There was never any sort of abuse or mistreatment. She just has a very strong personality and can sometimes be insensitive when she's expressing her opinion. He just carte blanche decided that our daughter is never allowed to be around her again without getting my input on that decision. I personally think a decision as serious as not allowing a family member to be around our daughter should probably be a well discussed, mutual decision and not something decided because he personally has a grudge.Anyways, he started saying things like I was taking his baby away from him, and I don't care about how he feels. She's spending one night at my aunt's house with people who I know love her and will take good care of her. That's hardly taking her away. Besides, I have not had an overnight break from the baby since she was about 4 months old. Sometimes parents need a night to themselves so they don't get burned out.He's acting like I just did this without consulting him instead of the reality that I asked him, and he made the choice not to give me a yes or a no.

10tex56,48,"My parents borrowed almost USD4,000 from me in order to pay my sister's fee-reduced tuition fee (that was her entire tuition and admission fee within that USD4000 amount). Both for transfer rate- and overall-saving reasons, I paid it and my parents agreed to pay me back when my sister flies back home for spring break; the original plan was for my sister to receive the payment in cash and return it to me. I was happy to just let that happen; in fact when they asked me what the full amount was, I just said I'll tell them when I need it.Now, recently, my company has been doing some layoffs for a restructuring, and I work and live abroad for this company; my work visa is due for renewal in March. However, as a pretty low-level employee, and after a person was hired one job level above me in November (presumably to replace me when the time came and my replacement was sufficiently onboarded), I have enough reason to believe I might be laid off, or otherwise I might be forced to resign just so they don't pay my severance pay or straight up fire me. Additionally, my job is stressful due to my coworkers being quite bigoted against people like me, and my chronic illness (I won't say what, as it could reveal who I am) relapsed twice already over the past year due to the job and me catching COVID as a direct result of the job sending me on a business trip abroad, and as per doctors' orders, I honestly need a break as I've been working nonstop for almost 2 years now. Clearly, I need a plan to fly back home, and with the job market as it is, I may need a few months' worth of rent and food expenses till I find a new job, not to mention all the cancellation fees for my internet bill, rent, etc.Therefore, when my sister said yesterday that she's actually not flying back for spring break, I then asked my parents how I might get my money back. I explained to them my situation how I might be laid off or need to leave for these reasons above, and my father blew up and started insulting me and calling me weak, rude, irresponsible, and that I only care about money. I tried telling him to stop and he straight up called me cheap for asking for my money back. He knows I don't make that much a year, he's seen how terrible my apartment looks, I explained to him my job is underpaying me, might lay me off and force me to leave, and my coworkers are bigoted and have been causing me to relapse my chronic illness twice, and yet he thinks asking for USD4000 back, which is half of my net worth right now, is me just being money-hungry.For context, I'm not especially well-off, I'm young and I only make USD27,000 a year, and as mentioned my company has been seeing some layoffs recently. AITA for asking them to give me back the money especially since it looks like I may have to leave the country and will need the money when I fly back home?EDIT: I wanted to add that I actually went to the country I'm in right now not because I even want to live here but because one of the universities offered a full ride scholarship covering tuition and expenses, so I don't also owe them anything for tuition or any uni education since they didn't pay a dime of it for me.",AITA for asking my parents my ~$4000 back?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tex56/aita_for_asking_my_parents_my_4000_back/

Welp. One honeymoon night and a few weeks later I got the double line for the first time ever on the pee-stick. Soo yeah.This is when our argument really began, although it has already kind of been in the back of our minds as a potential issue once we did decide to start trying - his mom (my MIL) is what I consider to be a HEAVY smoker. She no longer smokes when I come over because she knows I am asthmatic and somewhat allergic to smoke, but her house is still literally INFUSED with smoke and the nicotine smell. I actually make sure to not wash my hair whenever I know I'm going to her house ahead of time so that I can wash it as soon as I get home, because it's so bad that my hair and clothes retain the smell and then it makes me sneezy, eye watery and sniffly going to bed, which I can't stand. I have also made it clear to husband whenever I go to her house for more than a couple of hours that it has become a sacrifice of my health that I'm making every time, because I start coughing really bad after a few hours there, and the next day in the morning I feel as though I've smoked a whole pack of cigarettes myself (in other words my lungs hurt, my nose is stuffed, and I feel like complete shit for a whole day after).Having said that, I truly do love my MIL, we get along really well most of the time and she is so sweet and caring- I always say I lucked out in the MIL department.I know quitting smoking is insanely difficult, but at some point don't you have to stop to think about how everyone around you is getting impacted by it? ALSO she is always more than welcome to come over our house but she apparently refuses to drive on the freeway and a 30 minute drive is too long for her... she is 62 years old. I personally find that ludicrous considering my parents are in their mid-60's and commuting over 2 hours a day on the fwy every day to work still.

I made it clear to my roommate that this roll is off-limits and for emergencies only.Yesterday, my roommate came to me and asked to use the extra roll of toilet paper.

But instead of understanding, he got mad and started calling me selfish and unreasonable.Now, let's be real here, it's just a roll of toilet paper. But I refuse to be caught off guard again. I don't want to run out in the middle of the night or on the weekend when stores are closed. So what if it's just one extra roll for emergencies? I think it's a reasonable request.My roommate, on the other hand, thinks I'm being ridiculous. He says that I can just go buy another roll if we run out and that I'm making a big deal out of nothing. But he just doesn't get it. It's not about the toilet paper, it's about the principle. I made it clear that the extra roll was off-limits, and he should respect that.I've tried to explain this to him, but he just won't listen. He's completely unwilling to understand where I'm coming from and he's being a real drama queen about the whole thing. Now, he's not speaking to me and it's just turned into this whole big drama over something really trivial and insignificant.So, am I the asshole here or is my roommate just being a entitled brat over something that shouldn't even be a problem?

I worked out of town and I never married any of their mothers.  I did always pay child support and tried my best to give them meaningful gifts and experiences when they were growing up.  I took them to the Calgary stampede.  I took them camping.  I took an interest in their extracurricular activities.  I went to their hockey and ringette games.

10tyofy,20,"I (30F) have been with my boyfriend (27M) for 3 years, living together for 2. We don't have kids but have discussed marriage and starting a family together.BF's family lives across the country, we see them once a year. My family lives within about 30 mins from us, so I see them once every other week, at least once a month. My family gets together for everything -- holidays, birthdays, promotions, even if there's no reason other than just seeing each other.BF doesn't usually come. He'll say he's too tired or that he can't do anything during the week because of his work. (Both of us have WFH office jobs so it's nothing blue-collar, he means he's mentally exhausted.) If my family plans something for the weekend, he needs the full weekend to relax.I don't mind when he misses smaller events like dinners and birthdays, but it upsets me when he misses holidays. Since we've been together he hasn't gone to Thanksgiving or Christmas with my family, even though he doesn't have any other plans.He always tells me he just imagines the holidays with me, him, and our future children. But even married couples will see their families during the holidays?I never force him to go, but he says he always feels bad. As soon as I leave he'll change his mind, but he never goes the next time.My family thinks he's avoiding them. Nobody's been mean or anything close, but they'll comment on his absence and joke to me, like he's always so busy he never has time to say hi, or that I must've broken up and I'm keeping up the lie of having a boyfriend.Even if I tell them he's working or sick, they all seem to see right through it, like they know all of his excuses are just excuses.It's putting me in a shitty position. I don't want to make him come to my family events because he's a grown man and I'm not his mom.But when he doesn't come, I have to deal with everybody asking where he is, if he's coming later, if he's coming next time, etc, and when I get home I have to comfort HIM for feeling bad that he didn't go.He said he really does like my family, but sometimes he doesn't want to be social. I get it, I'm not a sociable person either, but missing everything, especially holidays, sends a message. I told him that eventually they're just going to stop inviting him and he got upset. But isn't that just a normal consequence? The same thing would happen if your friends kept inviting you out and you kept dodging them.When we visit his family I go to everything, like I basically force myself to be sociable even when I'm not feeling it. He told me this isn't the same because my family gets together TOO often, and since we rarely see his family we're cramming as much as possible.I feel like I can't win, like everything I propose sounds demanding or insensitive.

So I’m muslin and most muslims have a watering can in the bathroom (those who don’t have a bidet) so we can pour water into it and watch our privates with it. I explained this to her and to be honest it was really awkward explaining this in front of like 10+ people (most of them were not Muslim so they aren’t familiar with the hygiene practices in our religion). Anyways I kid you not this woman has the caucasity to say “That’s a bit unhygienic considering that you cooked us dinner tonight” then continued to laugh. First of all we have soap in the bathroom and I’m very big on hygiene so best believe I wash my hand thoroughly every time I use the bathroom.

I’ve been surviving and able to pay our $2300 rent but slowly slipping into more debt. Our lease is up end of April and I have made the decision to leave the house and downsize to an apartment to save money and take the physical load of caring for a house off of my plate. My 25F sister lives with me and has been paying $425 in rent since March of 2021. She moved in with us when I was still with my ex husband and he financially supported our family. When I decided to leave my husband, I didn’t raise her rent. She makes around $16.50/hr working full time hours. She has minimal bills (car payment, phone, car insurance) and to be frank, has the financially maturity of a 16-18y/o. She doesn’t help me with house chores even after asking her several times over the years, maybe she does the dishes like once a month.

We all came together to buy a cake, a present as well as all the others cost for the party. Everything went well that day and since we prepared lot of food there were ton of leftovers. Matter of fact, since there were other desserts as well barely anyone touched the birthday cake aside for my sister and some of the kids. We bought a huge one, I mean REALLY huge (we were 15adults and 5kids so we just decided to go all out with it), and since it was my sister's cake we obviously went home with the barely touched huge birthday cake. The next day, since I didn't have any slice of that cake I asked my sister if I could have a slice, she said yes and I cut one. I then went back to her to show her the slice. She was visibly uncomfortable with my slice so I handed her the knife I used to cut it and she left me with a tiny little cube. I was mad because the cake was huge and my original slice wasn't that big to begin with but, I respected her choice since, again, it was her birthday cake. I ate the slice she gave me and never asked again. I believe I saw the box in the trash some days later and as she ended up eating it completly alone. Now back to today's problem. I quit my part-time job last week to focus on my master's thesis and got my last salary yesterday. Today, I decided to go shopping a little and came accross a small bakery. When I saw the cakes I decided to buy a small one to treat myself and got home. We all share the same fridge so I just put it in there after eating some. Well, I assume all of you know what happened next... My sister came home, saw my cake and asked if she could have some. I said no because I wanted to eat it alone and she litterally exploded. Starting calling me selfish for buying things like that for myself only when we're 3 in the house. I told her that she herself ate her bd cake alone so I don't see why I need to share my cake with anyone and she ended up calling her mother who then called our father who called me to ask to share my cake and I still said no... Rn i'm in my room with the cake and i'm contemplating just eating it whole in one go because I know she'll try something if I let it in the fridge...

10ua017,7,"I (15F) have a friend (15F) in school, let’s call her Nat. We’ve known each other for about 4 years now, and even though it’s been a while, I wouldn’t call us necessarily close. Last week, during break time in school, she and a bunch of my classmates were gathered around my desk (I was eating), talking about random things. After some time, the conversation began to turn into the kind that to me, is unacceptable. Context: Another classmate (14F), had a relationship with a boy from another school, and had sent certain pictures to him, that he leaked to his friends. By certain pictures, I mean explicit ones. She had told me about this when she got to know, and trusted me to keep it a secret (which I did). I, as well as my friend Nat have experienced body image issues and have been made fun of because of it.They started gossiping about this situation, and when I heard I immediately told them that it wasn’t any of our business, and that we should just move on. My friend Nat didn’t try and stop them, but instead egged them on by saying that the classmate whose pictures were leaked, was flat and shouldn’t have sent those pictures knowing this. I was appalled and left the classroom, and she followed me asking what was wrong (I was clearly angry). I asked her if she really thought it was right to not only gossip about such personal things, but also make fun of the person involved. She said it wasn’t a big deal, and that by sending pictures that person was accepting the consequences. I told her that until she thought about what she did and why I reacted the way I did, and apologised to the person involved, I wouldn’t talk to her. Keep in mind I also explained that it is my principle to not talk about such things and make fun of people about their bodies or anything, and that if she didn’t want to apologise, she didn’t have to, I just wouldn’t talk to her— out of my own personal moral.After this some of her friends started telling me I was an asshole for choosing not to talk to her until she did something about it, because again (like she had said) it wasn’t any of their business, and the person involved should have known these things would happen. I just told them that she probably knows she made a mistake, and at this point in time all she needs is support (talking about the person involved) that people (her literal classmates), aren’t giving her. I also added that I only told Nat what I felt, if she didn’t want to do anything about it, she didn’t have to. The only reason I feel like I might be an asshole is because even if we aren’t close, Nat and I have been friends for a couple of years, in my head I feel guilty for turning on her.Edit: Person involved has talked to a school counsellor and they are taking action.",AITA for not wanting to talk to my friend because of someone else’s problem?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ua017/aita_for_not_wanting_to_talk_to_my_friend_because/
10sguco,2681,"My son is 12 and we are very close. We always spend one day a month together.The day is always the same. We wake up slightly later than usual, have a pancake breakfast, hang out at the rink for a couple hours, head to the arcade to try the claw machines, then eat dinner at this Indian restaurant before heading home and watching a movie with dessert.It’s important to us and we always do everything I mentioned. We’ve been doing it since he was 5. I always let him and my boyfriend know the date a week prior. On the morning of the day, my boyfriend decided to clean the kitchen and threw out the pancake mix. He then forgot to fill up the gas in my car so we had to go the gas station but it took forever because of traffic. Then when we finally got to the rink, he called me about 20 times to ask where something is or to discuss something about his daughter. We had to leave quickly so that the restaurant wouldn’t close so we skipped the arcade. When we were half way through eating my boyfriend called and said that he hurt himself. We packed up the food and rushed home only to find out that he hit his ankle against something but was ok otherwise. He then refused to let us watch the movie because he was watching something and he started eating the food we brought. My son called him a dick before stomping up to his room. I was just in shock. My boyfriend’s NEVER done this before and I really could not tell if he was being oblivious or if he was doing this on purpose. Boyfriend was all like “You just gonna let that slide?”I rolled my eyes at him before saying ”enjoy the food” I then went to our room. He followed after me asking me wtf my problem is. I told him that he knows how important this day is and he got pissed and was like “is that what this is about? I’m important too you know!“ I kind of snapped and told him that he isn’t as important as my son and that he ruined our day by acting like a little child. He went quiet, said that I’m being a bitch then left. He won’t answer any of my calls but texted my son saying that he expects an apology. It’s 5am and I haven’t been able to sleep. AITA here? Please be honest. I need to know if I was really being a bitch and if I overreacted or something.Edit: We’re in our 30s but he’s a couple years older, his daughter is 20 and has her own mom.

10twp1n,46,"My (F20) best friend (M20, let's call him Josh) and I have been having some trouble lately, after he hanged out with a friend that I introduced him and didn't invite me. This hurt me a lot because I always do my best to include everyone in everything and he has become part of my friend group because of this, a couple of weeks ago I introduced another friend of mine to the others and last week that friend and Josh made a plan without me. It really sucked that they didn't even consider to invite me and I felt really left out. It is also important to explain that almost ever since I've known Josh I've suggested that he went to therapy for a number of reasons. I go to therapy myself (both psychologist and psyquiatrist) because I have bpd and anxiety, but he's always said that he didn't think he had anything serious like I do and didn't want to go. At one point, a long time ago, due to his inability to set boundaries with me, I said that I wouldn't feel comfortable being his friend if he didn't get professional help. He agreed to do it, but only ended up going to 3 free counseling sessions that his University offered. I let it go, because it seemed like he was better. This has been an ongoing debate between us, but I understand that I cannot control what he does and so I tried to not bring it up as much. These past few weeks, however, because of the issue I explained at the beginning, have been quite tense. The worst thing is that whenever I get upset with Josh, it ends up feeling like he is the most hurt by the situation and I end up feeling guilty (this has to do also with my bpd, because in other occasions I have gotten upset without reason and sometimes it's hard to manage my feelings).Tonight he was feeling very very bad about the whole thing and asked me to call him, so I did. This caused me to feel very divided, because I had to push away my feelings about how he had behaved and try to console him and worry about him. I decided it wasn't fair and told him to please seek professional help, again, he refused because ""it wasn't such a big deal and it would go away on it's own"". I told him that if that was true he didn't need me, so we hang up. After a few minutes he texted me saying he wasn't feeling good, so I responded by texting him the number of the clinic I go to and saying that if he wanted to call me again he had to promise to call on Monday and make an appointment. He got mad at me and said it wasn't fair.

I am on my 5th day on CBD, and with the stress and everything I decided I would take a pill to sleep better, but the problem is I could'nt get out of bed this morning (11:20 am on a sunday). I heard my mother in the kitchen telling her boyfriend how disappointed she was about me not being abble to get up at 10-10:30 am on the morning like I did last week.

10txt85,10,"I've recently started going out to parties with classmates and friends. I've been going out more frequently to parties with one friend who I met a couple years ago. She's not my closest friend but we've worked together on a couple projects and I trust her dearly. She knows quite a bit about me, some stuff that's very private and I've never told anybody else. She's on the smaller side and probably one of the sweetest, most personable people you'll ever meet. If I'm being honest, I do have some feelings for her.Anyhow, every party I've ever gone to with her she's gotten shitfaced at. Every time she's promised us (her best friends and I) that she'll take it easy and be responsible; every time she's broken that promise. The last party I went to with her was in the same week as another one (think one on Monday and another on Friday) and I was responsible for driving her. I asked her, hell, I practically begged her to take it easy. She promised that she wouldn't drink. Not even a half hour after we got there she was drunk. I took her to a quiet area and tried to get her to sober up, nope, she managed to get more. Then, when she realized she had broken her promise, she asked me to lie to her best friend and to keep the fact that she was drunk a secret. This cycle continued for 3 hours.I drove her and some friends home at around 1 in the morning. When it was only her and her best friend in the car, I stopped and I flipped at her. Yelling. I yelled at her for a good couple minutes. She cried. She didn't even try to defend herself and neither did her best friend. She didn't make a sound. She looked like a frightened child.I was pissed for a few reasons:1) This was the third time she had promised not only me, but her closest friends that she'd be responsible. This was the third time she had broken her word. Once is a mistake, twice is suspect, thrice is a lie.2) Every time that she has gotten drunk, she became a burden to everybody that loves her. Her closest friends have gotten in trouble for being home late because they were taking care of her. 3) When she realized she was drunk and had broken her word, her first reaction wasn't to apologize and come clean, her first reaction was to ask me to lie to our friends to hide it. She also asked me help her hide it from her family.I outlined these three points when I was yelling at her. I believe that she needs to know. I've tried to tell her a million times but obviously she wasn't listening. I couldn't think of anything else to try. I feel like shit cause she was powerless when I was yelling at her.

I helped them both, I even did their work for them and explained it to them how I did it. One of them was grateful, but the other one started questioning me and accusing me of doing it wrong on purpose because her group didn't do it like that (it worked in a way that the work that member 1 does is needed for member 2, and what member 2 does is needed for member 3 and so on) and she asked me to explain it to her again, after I already did multiple times.

I'm Indian-American (no, not a Native American, I'm half-Punjabi, half-Gujarati) from California and my friend's an Italian-American from NYC who moved here for a job 10 years ago.I work as a freelancer, she's currently working for a mom-and-pop fashion store which sells imported women's swimwear.My friend is a very close friend, known her 10 years.In my day job, social media is part and parcel of it anyway; I ghostwrite 3 Twitter accounts and 1 Instagram, in addition to doing some sudo'ing and SSH'ing for an up-and-coming influencer (all those Mac commands are useful!)We haven't even got any material up yet, as we're planning things.My friend (and co-founder) suggested we put some short videos up on TikTok, but I said to her that TikTok isn't great for data protection. She seemed to think that because people like the Kardashians used TikTok it was fine for ordinary people to do so.As it is, she was surprised, but said we needed to use TikTok ""to keep ahead of the pack"".In order to resolve this conflict, I said we needed to do a much more thorough analysis of how to keep privacy safe.I suggested we use wordpress.com and host some of our downloadable content via GitHub and AppKed so there's a mirror of our content for offline usage.GitHub and AppKed seem to be better at privacy than Google, and Google is the lesser of two evils over TikTok, ain't it?I said to him I'd talk to my friend whose wedding we've both been invited to in 6 weeks' time and he agreed with me about being wary about TikTok and said he'd be happy to discuss it with us and give advice, pro bono (normally he charges a large fee for drafting privacy policies; like me, he's a freelancer with his own business). I've known him for 15 years.Anyway, our new venture's in the planning stages, it's not a startup, as it's not about making profit, but it's a good little side venture for me since I've never actually had social media under my own name (even this Reddit account is a throwaway with info changed for privacy).My question is, AITA here for suggesting we don't use TikTok and instead focus on services that provide good privacy for us and customers?","AITA for suggesting to my friend we don't use TikTok in our new venture's social media, instead sticking to a YouTube, WordPress, GitHub and AppKed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u935t/aita_for_suggesting_to_my_friend_we_dont_use/

10tjgct,58,"Hi,Thank you for reading this in advance. Earlier last year I (24M) bought a 2 bed flat in London, one of my friends moved in with me and rented the other room. My flatmate told me he was going to move in with his gf. I have been looking for the past month (advertising online etc.) to try and find someone, but I haven't got anywhere. His rent is up on the 8th Feb.I have a large mortgage on the flat so a roommate is needed. If I were to try and cover the cost of the flat with just my income I would just be able to scrape by but it would be difficult. My mum signed the mortgage with me, she is effectively a guarantor for this mortgage, but there is no intention for her to pay any money towards this long term. In a few years I should be able to fully afford the flat by myself, and in the meantime I will rent the room to make up the difference. She will cover the cost of the other room between flatmates, but I will have to pay this money back to her when I sell the flat. Currently around 65% of my monthly mortgage payments pay off the interest, this is the effective rate of interest on the money my mum loans to me which is very high! I am therefore very keen to avoid this possibility.I initially wasn't bothered about the gender of any potential flatmate. I grew up with 3 sisters so I am very used to living with women, at uni I lived with a mix as well so I didn't think much of the gender. Around a week ago my gf mentioned to me that she might find it uncomfortable if I had a girl move in with me (gf does not live in the flat, we have been dating a year), she said especially because it would just be the 2 of us it would make her uncomfortable as it would mean I was talking to a woman about issues at work, issues with friends, issues in our relationship maybe. If you get on with your flatmate I can understand why that would be a close relationship.At the time I said I understand her feelings, and I will do my best to find a guy because I want to make her comfortable. But I also pointed out that as of Feb 8th I don't have anyone to pay my rent, bills etc. She said she understood and that she realises that this isn't her decision, but she wanted to say her bit.Reddit WIBTA if a girl moved in with me? I have a girl coming to look at the flat tomorrow, and when I mentioned this to my gf she went quiet. She said she understood that ""I've got to do what I've got to do"", but she is uncomfortable with the situation. I don't want to upset her but at the same time if I have to keep on waiting to find someone to fill this room it's costing me money every day its empty. I've actively tried to get guys in, I almost had a guy earlier this week but he wanted somewhere with better transport connections so at the last minute pulled out. If I can I would like to have a guy in here to make this easier for her but I don't think I can really be picky anymore?Thanks in advance and happy weekend!",WIBTA for letting a girl move in with me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tjgct/wibta_for_letting_a_girl_move_in_with_me/
10t1ufw,90,"In early December my parents were asking me what I wanted for Christmas. I didn't really have anything I wanted, but my mom always complains about how crappy my favorite pair of boots looks (they're a pair of Docs I bought secondhand over a decade ago, they're pretty torn up) so I figured I'd ask for a new pair of nice boots. I sat down with my mom and we looked at boots on their site and found a pair we both liked. Christmas comes around and my parents admit that they haven't gotten them yet because they wanted to pick them up from the store instead of paying for shipping which I was fine with, and they both said they would get them for me soon.My parents and I talked on the phone multiple times over the next month, and every time we would talk they would mention the boots, and say they were going to get them soon. Two weeks ago (Jan 18th) my girlfriend tells me that her best friend's boyfriend is going to propose to her, and my girlfriend wants to have a party at her apartment where it will happen. Her best friend's birthday is Feb 7th, so the party is going to be the weekend before. She wants it to be absolutely perfect, and so we started planning, including outfits. My outfit included the boots that my parents said they were going to get.That Sunday night (22nd) I sent my parents a text letting them know that I need the boots by the first weekend of Feb. I had phone calls with each of them last week where they both confirmed getting the text, confirm understanding the time limit, and they both say that they were getting the boots that week. I visit them Sunday and they haven't gotten the boots. I tell them I would prefer that they get them early in the week as I'm going to be running errands to help my girlfriend prep for the party as the weekend approaches.I text my parents Mon m to remind them. They say that they forgot but promise they'll get them Tues so I can come pick them up on time. Same thing Tues. I remind them Wed morning, and ask my dad about them when he calls me about something else and he yells at me because I only wanted to talk about the boots.Thursday I buy the boots myself. I pick them up on the way home from work, and text my parents afterwards telling them they don't need to get me the boots because I got them myself.My dad calls me an hour later yelling about how they said they were going to get the boots and I went out and got them instead and how I had made my mom cry by buying them myself. My mom never responded to the message I sent her after that call. This morning my sisters both text me saying that I had made mom cry the night before, and my aunt called me in the early afternoon asking what I had done to make my mom cry. Potentially unrelated but I was planning on going to a show with my cousin and she hasn't been responding to my messages today (she's 20 and in college so I understand a lack of responses on a normal Friday).",AITA for buying some boots my parents said they would get me for Christmas?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10t1ufw/aita_for_buying_some_boots_my_parents_said_they/
10u01k1,23,"I (17f) my dad (m) in his late 40s. Recently it’s been in the Lower 40’s. We live in the south where it’s typically warmer. My father would tell stories of when he lived in the north as a young kid walking in the snow to school every time I complain about the cold. Recently I come home to the worlds hottest house, times where the thermostat would be set to 85 degrees! I find this very hypocritical, and sometimes it’s even hotter. I understand it’s colder outside recently however I don’t think it’s normal to sweat after coming inside from 40 degree weather. Just recently I woke up to the house once again at 85 at one in the morning. I go to change the thermostat and instead meet face to face with my father, not exactly face to face more like I encountered him on the computer going to change the thermostat. He then yelled at me telling me that if I was hot I should just turn the vent to my room off. I’ve spoken to my friends and found out it’s not normal to have the temperature over 80 but because he’s older and it’s his house I should just leave him be. I was also told by my relatives that I don’t pay bills or have a job so I should just wear comfortable clothes.

10th0g6,40,"Brother had his first child 2 weeks ago. He is currently not working and he has about $70k in shares but didn’t want to sell any right now because “it’s not the right market to sell” so him and his partner moved in with my parents about a month before the baby came. They stayed with her mother for the first week but have been back in the parents house for a week now. So far they haven’t let my parents even touch the baby let alone hold it. Tomorrow they (my parents) are going overseas for 8 weeks. My dad was diagnosed with cancer a few weeks ago and wants to see his siblings overseas before he starts treatment as he hasn’t seen any of them since before the pandemic. I suggested it would be nice if they could hold the baby for a few minutes before they go overseas, especially as today is my dads birthday. Brother ripped into me for butting in, telling him how to raise his child, treating the baby like a toy for people to play with, being insensitive to what it’s like for him and his partner as new parents etc etc. He then claimed that the only reason they hadn’t let them hold the baby was because they hadn’t asked to and he didn’t know if they wanted to or not, which is total BS in my opinion because a) what grandparent wouldn’t want to and b) they stay in their separate lounge room almost all the time the baby is awake with the door shut which is a pretty obvious signal that they don’t want my parents involved in any way apart from living in their house rent free, eating their groceries, and letting my parents do all their laundry. They’ve taken over most of the house as well. My brothers old bedroom got turned into their personal lounge room, the rumpus room/parents office got turned into their bedroom, my sisters old bedroom is now a clothes drying room/my brothers office and my old bedroom is a junk room.

About 2 months prior to the birth they hadn’t done any baby preparation at all as they had been travelling around the state to attend opera concerts every weekend so my parents bought a few baby supplies for them and my brother told them that they were “taking over” and that his partner didn’t want to move in to the house even though they couldn’t afford anything else without selling some of his shares because she was afraid that they would take over raising the baby, hence why they haven’t asked to hold the child themselves.4.

I ask her to elaborate and she tells me that I should have ran it through not just her, but my counselor. I told her that she should have actually read it. She then tells me that I can make it up but the highest score I can get is a 75.

My friend complimented me on my necklace and earrings but later on before the ceremony the bride pulled me to the side and said that she said not to wear anything that was too flashy or showy to which I responded that I didn't think that it was and that ""too showy"" is subjective to the person. She kinda gave a huff and was obviously irritated from that point on, though she never asked me to take off my jewelry so I left it on for the whole ceremony and reception afterwards  but after the reception she brought it up again and we started to argue about it and I said that my cultural jewelry wasn't flashy or showy at all and it was cultural items that I'm wearing.

It was hell for me and my mom, person never cleaned, and hoarded all her stuff into our living room, you couldn’t walk there. She would eat, sleep, and work in our living room and barely left. She was supposed to find a place of her own. she stayed for over 3 years. What made this bad was our family was trying to help my Grandma, and she was lounging around our house. She left a few months ago, finally. Problem #2, before person moved out, our Grandma didn’t make it, this really hurt because she was the center. Family events were at her house. A week after my Grandma’s passing, people in our family wanted my mom and aunt to babysit their kids. I was infuriated because I knew my mom was upset. It was so out of line, they lost their mom, and people in the family want them to babysit their kids. Not even giving time to digest everything that happened. This is the moment I started to look at my family members differently.Problem #3, my cousin, let’s call her “persona”. she was sleeping around and got pregnant as a teen. People told her to stop, she didn’t listen. Now that’s she’s older, she neglecting her kid. He’s like 9 now. It’s pissing me off because now my mom and aunt have to step up, spend money, and raise him.

We have to spend money for him all the time. Our house has become some place for babysitting. I’m frustrated with persona because this is her fault, she won’t contact his father, she doesn’t do crap and because of her BS, everyone else has to step up for her kid. My mom has asked why are you happy to see the other kids but not personas kid. I told her straight up, I’m tired of them too but at least they go back home. When he’s here he has stay every weekend.

I have a little brother (7m) that i took in after this. 7m is on the spectrum but so am I. So far his been easy to take care of, my condition doesn't flare up and me being on the spectrum helps me understand him better than probably anyone, and i think that's very important.For the record this isn't a financial burden on me. I live in government housing so its a stable home with cheap rent, my pension was already more than enough to live on just for me and i now get payments for him added on to my pension (As i said i get more than enough from my pension so i put this money into a bank account for him in the furture).

The other day, me and a couple of friends were playing a card game the our friend, Rachel (fake name) had brought. One thing that is necessary to know here, is that Rachel most likely has DID, or something along those lines, and it is clear they are not faking it. One of the alternatives that they have, we’ll call them Sarah, is much more emotional than Rachel, and can get upset much more easily. It is important in this story, as apparently a majority of this conversation was when Sarah was fronting (we didn’t know of this). It was a rather intense round, but we all were laughing while yelling at each other though, so it was a fun time. Then Sarah while grinning, proceeded to slam down a card, and make a move the we decided to not allow, since it wasn’t fair. I had tried to do it in the past and everyone, including her, said no. The rest of us immediately protested against this, and it started a rather heated debate, that most of us were laughing during (it’s a game). When I stated that “ hey I wasn’t allowed to do that before when I was trying to do it” they quickly responded with “do you seriously care that much about a past game that much?”. We ended up not allowing it, and we figured that it was just a funny, but heated debate we had. After all of us got home, however, Sarah sent us all a screenshot, saying that what they were trying to do was a fair play, on the game’s official page. We all kind of assumed that this was all in a light hearted manner, and was responding sarcastically. However, they BLEW UP. They called us “sore losers” and said “you all jumped in to try and prove that I’m stupid”. We never did such a thing, so we were all confused. We finally realized it was Sarah talking to us instead of Rachel, and after a while, we finally managed to get Rachel talking to us. All of us never said anything hostile, and only responded with really calm responses. Rachel started dming only me, and they still didn’t really understand why we weren’t allowing that play, especially since it was allowed on the official site. I explained that it was just how we played before, and to us it felt like cheating, and this conversation kept going back and forth. Eventually Sarah stepped in to the conversation again, and said that I should stop manipulating Rachel since I know they always say yes to everything. After that I decided to end the conversation since it was going nowhere. At the time I felt that I was in the right, but now I’m not so sure, as what they said is true, and it may just be my pettiness that is not allowing it to happen.

10to87k,19,"A bit of background. I'm (25m) Indian, so expenses that might seem low for you as a western reader are a lot higher for me. My mother is a SAHM. She is unfortunately not financially independent. I landed my dream job 6 months ago, and divide my income 3 ways, a third going to investments, a third going to my personal expenses and savings and a third going all to her.Regarding the financial situation of our family, both me and my father earn well, but he recently took out an expensive insurance and I joined the labour force only recently, and haven't hit my savings goal yet.Coming to the issue, my cousin (26f) is getting married soon. She comes from a rather poor household and never owned any jewellery growing up. I zeroed in on a few beautiful and yet reasonably priced earrings and necklaces that cost anything between $300 - $400. It would be a bit of a stretch for me to fund it all by myself, so I made a mental note to ask my father to split the expense closer to the wedding date and gift it collectively as a family.I was shocked to learn today that my mother already collaborated with my cousin and her mother (my aunt) to choose a $900 jewellery for my cousin. What's worse is that she literally said, ""It's a gift from me and (my name)"" without even consulting with me in the first place. Now, she asked me to pay her $400 while she will be funding the rest from her own savings.While I can cover the expense if I really have to, it will put me in a vulnerable position for a month or two if an emergency expense comes up, so I told her that gifting my cousin a $900 piece is a terrible idea. However, my mom insists on gifting it. Both of us have extremely strong and dominant personalities, so I told her that I won't be paying a single penny of the 900 dollars while said that she'll burn all her savings on it if that's the last thing she does.I might have yet agreed to pay if I actually liked the necklace that was picked, but it's rather old fashioned while I prefer modern, sleek and elegant designs.I am aware of my mother's finances and can well understand that if she covers the entire expense herself, it would put her in quite a good amount of financial distress for at least a quarter, if not more.

They were diagnosed with autism which is fine and I do not care about at all but since he was diagnosed he’s started being really difficult to deal with. He always has to be right and even whenever he’s wrong he’ll be persistent that he’s right and then get pissed off.To give an example: the other day we were talking abt sitcoms and I brought up “the good place” he said that the good place wasn’t a sitcom and when I said it was he googled it (he wanted to prove he was right) Google said that it was a sitcom and he tried to argue that me and google were wrong and he was right.I’ve mentioned before that it’s annoying that he always has to be right and he said “it’s because I am always right and you’re just stupid”. The thing that rlly bugs me abt him is that every time I say anything critics abt him he always responds with “it’s because of my autism” but if it was then he would’ve have always behaved that way.Sometimes I think abt lashing out and telling him how much of a dick he is but if I did it would be awkward as we go to a club together and get rides with each others parents.

Phoebe, completely out of the blue, started to talk about archaeology to George’s mother.**TL;DR:** She started talking about some obscure South American indigenous mummies.In detail, she talked about about an ancient native boy who was found buried with a purposefully punctured (broken) “antara” flute next to his mouth, that they called a “killed instrument” as it was meant to never be played by anyone else, in the same way it was played once by its owner. The flute was made of stone called “combarbalita”, which means it was meant to last through generations, so it had to be broken on purpose. She talked about a connection between the flute and its owner being buried together, and the idea that the instrument was willfully broken in order to bring the instrument closer to his owner in eternity, achieving immortality for both of them by that irreversible action of breaking an instrument that was meant to last forever.&amp;#x200B;I’m basically paraphrasing but that was the idea. I can use some of her fancy words because she literally air dropped the article she was talking about, right there at the service. I’m wasting characters on this just so you know how obscure the conversation was.I get the idea. I get the intention. It is interesting… for a college class. In the context of a funeral for our dear friend, however, I thought it was out of pocket and sort of distasteful, disrespectful, to talk about that.George’s mother was polite and she asked some questions but she was mostly quiet just listening to Phoebe talking non-stop. Then, George’s father and brother approached us and she was about to start to tell them the whole damn story once again. I quietly said “Please don’t…” she was about to start rambling so I told her “just shut the f\*ck up, please”.She didn’t speak to me for that entire evening. We talked about it later, back in our place and I explained why I reacted that way. She said “ gotcha, you’re fine” but she has acted differently to me since that day. One of my friends told me that I ‘broke’ her and it does feel that way. It’s almost like she’s a robot and her software it’s malfunctioning. Tension is high for both of us and George’s death hit us hard on both of us, so IDK if I’m missing something.

10sj8v8,637,"I (24m) am throwing my own birthday dinner for my family and close friends this weekend. I'm moving out of state next week and wanted to hang out one last time with my entire family. However, I specifically told me older sister(35f) that under no circumstances is she to bring my nephew (8m) to the party. Here why:1. My gf is on medication and has gained a considerable amount of weight due it and he has taken to calling her ""fatty"" every single chance he gets. This is something she's very insecure about I know it hurts her feelings. 2. The kid doesn't know how to share. If there is a dish on the dining table he likes he empties the entire bowl on to his plate and throws a tantrum if someone tries to take some off his plate. One time I was hanging out with him, my sister and my my mum, I had exactly 5 left over macaroons so everyone could at least eat one. He grabbed the box and eat of all them completely ignoring me when I told me he had to share. Almost every person in my family has tried to tell my sister that her son's behavior is not acceptable and her only response now is that 'i can't help it, he doesn't listen' or 'he's just a kid, he'll grow out of it' So I told her you either come alone to the party or don't come at all but I don't want your kid there. Of course this led to her calling me immature and I didn't care. However, it wasn't until my mom pointed out that I was a grown man excluding a kid from a party that I started feeling that maybe i was overreacting.I still don't want him at the party, what do you think?

We're 7 and it takes forever to plan anything with everyone now that we started having partners and kids. So I told them 2 months in advance that I'm coming. They all put down the date and we started planning. Everyone is excited.On to the problem. Today one of my friends said she can't come anymore because her partner is going out with his friends and they don't have a babysitter for their 3 kids. His excuse you ask?? He saw that she had put down the date in their calender, but didn't put a time, so he just assumed he could spend the whole day with his friends. In what world is that okay? And then she continues to say that it's not the first time, and she has to choose her battles in her marriage. Some backstop, because this isn't their only problem. He literally has the same punishment as the kids if he doesn't pick up and clean after himself. He calls it ""babysitting"" his own kids. He will not put the kids to bed, because there is always a game to watch. And cooking and cleaning is just that magically happens. And probably a lot more I don't remember or know about.So I called her and we had a long chat, where I told her it's about time she left him. She said she would think about it. But then a couple of hours later I get a screaming phone call from him, calling me all sorts of names for involving myself in their marriage. I pretty much said ""Well, this phone call pretty much proves my point on you being the 4th child"" and then hung up.Yes I know it's not my marriage, but I'm so sick of hearing about their problems and never seeing her anymore.

10tsgck,29,"So, I just started a new position as GM and was debating whether to take it because I have such bad ADD and Executive Dysfunction. My kids supported me to give it a shot initially (my kids are grown but we still live together sharing expenses). I've been working 13 to 20 hour days/7 days a week to start and still have to keep texting work or taking calls when I'm home. One evening, one of my kids asked me if I am salary or hourly, and I told her that I am paid hourly. She lectured me that it's wage theft to work off the clock and basically demanded that I turn off  my phone so that we can watch the movie I promised to watch with her that evening. I explained to her that I can't do that as I am the GM and there is no 'off the clock' or whatever as I am the main person with all the responsibility now. She got really angry with me, but I was angry too because I felt that she wasn't supporting me as she initially had encouraged me to take the position.Later, after my back and forth texting with work ended, I started watching a TV show with my other kid. My daughter came back to see if I would watch the movie with her and I said, ""Yes once this episode ends. However, I fell asleep as I always do after eating and having a carb crash. When I woke up, the program was still on but it was on a new episode. My daughter came in and was infuriated that 2 hours had passed and that she had been waiting to watch the movie with me. I apologized and said I had fell asleep and forgot (my forgetfulness is amplified to the nth degree with the lack of sleep I have been getting).My daughter was pissed and went to her room, but I never went to apologize because I was pissed too that she was being so demanding and not supporting me.

10u1q7c,13,"Hi. Me (17 18 in june) have been in the dating stage with this girl I really like, (17 18 in march) for a little over a month now. We've been on 2 public dates so far, one to get lunch, and then hung out blasting music in her car for a couple hours, and two went to a skating rink with her for a couple of hours. Now this next week I would like to go to this parade with her and meet her mom, and then later to go to her house for a few hours and meet her siblings and get to know them, and hang out alone for the first time. Right? sounds fine! Wrong. My mom believes it's too soon! Let me bring in another statement. My ex, who I jumped into a relationship with after a week of talking and meeting. My mother meets my ex and a week later let's me go over to her house. We decided we were official that first date. SO Not rushing things. Nextly she believes me and her should become official before we hang out alone. No. thats not how this works, I should not have to date somebody after a month of knowing them to hang out. The whole reason is so I can determine whether or not I should fully commit to this! I really like her but, every time we hang out my mom wants to know our every location and every place. Another thing is, we live in a dangerous city, however she lives in a town over THAT IS SUBURBS hardly any crime. So why is she so pressed about it? I completely understand her concern but am very uncomfortable with how she is going about it. I feel as though I can't even live. I never ask for anything. I've only ever had 2 friends sleep over 1 time each in my entire life living with her. My dad was much less tense about that. I've only asked for a few things and a few times to be with friends. And each time she watches my location and needs to make sure I don't move. She will watch my location to make sure it's not on the car, and if it is, she says ""I don't like where your phone is pinging"" She's always done this with my previous relationships.

10twlsz,28,"English is not my first language and I am typing this on mobile, so sorry for grammar mistakes!I (F26) got into a fight with my best friend (M23) 2 days ago. Possibly relevant: I have BPD and he has depression.We both live on our own, one street apart. We usually spend all our time together, unless to work and sleep, and always eat dinner together.Our work schedules don't line up, since I work nightshifts from 11PM till 7AM, and he works morning shifts from 9AM till 6PM. Our time together is less now, so to make up for it, when I have to work, my best friend usually walks me to the station, which is a 10 to 15 minute walk from our houses, and picks me up once I am done.It might be a simple, short walk, but I value that time spent together, so it is important to me, which he knows. Something I also have to mention here, is that I have a big problem with people who promise stuff, but don't follow up with it. This comes from my childhood, mainly my dad, who always made promises, yet never followed through. He also abandoned me in my childhood, after he divorced my mom.My best friend knows about this and knows I hate fake promises and feeling forgotten/abandoned. Every time he drops me off at the station, I ask him if he will pick me up after my shift and he always promises me he will. Sometimes I even double-ask. And he double reassures me.The problem is, my best friend is really forgetful and has a hard time doing basic tasks, due to his depression. Such as making appointments, remembering them and attending them and the biggest of all; my friend really struggles with being on time. He has a habit to sleep in a lot, not hearing his alarm clocks and he is often late for things.Because of this, it has happened numerous times already that, once I get out of the train, he isn't there. So then I walk home alone and feel sad/angry/hurt (depending on my mood, because my BPD is unpredictable). He now only shows up about 30% of the time.When I ask why he wasn't there, it's always: Lost his glasses, his alarms didn't go off, or wrong time, phone wasn't charging. With every time he is not there, my hurt grows.2 days ago, he forgot to pick me up again and I absolutely lost it this time. I got really angry and told him that it is important to me and that he keeps hurting me by not showing up. He said sorry and that he is trying his best, which I know, but I didn't accept the apology this time and kept being angry. This made him angry too and he said I am always nitpicking on him, being hard on him and the fight escalated. I accused him of things, he accused me of things and it got pretty nasty and it ended with him saying he doesn't want to be friends anymore. It's been 2 days and I haven't seen him, nor spoken to him and I really wanna make up.

10ty6ca,2,"I (21 F) Despise my father. He is a losey piece of crap. He was rarely there in our lives, and would rather have laid up under women then take care of his children. There is so many traumatic things that I went through as a child that no child should have to go through. One that is involved in the story is that I was put in fostercare from the age of 15 to a few months before my 17th birthday. It was awful, and the family that was supposed to be the closest to me abandonded me. (My fathers side of the family) I've tried to move forward with my life with my new partner and I had to move away for my own mental health away from my fathers side of the family. I hate them for what they have done to me.Although I saw these things about my father, I try my best to keep a relationship with him. I guess it's because the little girl inside of me still wants to still have her father in her life..One day, my father and I had a conversation. I don't know how the topic was brought up, but he had asked me multiple times if he was a good father. I just said yes so he'd leave me alone, because I knew that If I said no, he'd ask for a whole story as to why. Most of the things he have done to me was when he was drunk. (he was in and out of sobriety for a few years now). He started talking about how he wanted to have another child because me and my siblings do not really like him. I am only somewhat close to one of my siblings. Mind you, he was hoping back and forth between putting little effort in taking care of me and my brother, and my other brother and sister (They have a differnt mom) My brothers are 5 weeks apart and have the same name (named after him) so you can tell what type of man he is. He said that having another child he could do right by them. I flat out told him that taking care of a child is not as easy as it seems. It's not just about sending them money. (he never changed my diapers as a kid because he doesnt change girls) He needed to change their diaper, dress them, take them to appointments, take them to school, mold them into proper functioning people, Everything he didn't do with any of my siblings and I. The conversation was left sour.Well, a few weeks ago my father sent me a text message after trying to call. I ignored the call. He asked if i remembered when I was younger when I told him I could have a younger sister. I vaugly remembered him telling me this after telling me of his various flings. She said he wasn't the father and he moved on with his life. Well, the woman he slept with contacted him and told him he is infact the father of the child. My father was estatic. I simply said that he should get a DNA test to be sure, if this woman lied once, she could lie again! He then sent me a picture of the girl, saying that she looks just like me. i have to admit, there were small features, but again, i rheitorated that he needed to get a DNA test just to be sure. A few days later, he sent me pictures of him meeting the girl! Talking about how he was going to spoil and treasure her after finding his new daughter. This pissed me off. My father calls me all the time complaining about how child support is taking so much of his money away. ((It's well deserved because he never paid it he owes my mom her money)) He complains that any time I ask him for a little help getting myself situated, he doesn't have it, but he can buy my other sister $500 wigs and my brother a beam for his guns. He took my siblings to a 49rs game, but couldn't loan me $50 to help for bills when I was behind.This infuriated me beyond belief. My aunt says its because I used to be his favorite but thats far from the truth. Now my grandmother and aunt are involved. My grandmother called me today saying she was going to go see the girl. Aparently, she is in a group home now, (Her mother lost custody of her and she had behavior issues so her grandmother can no longer care for her) After the visit, my grandmother called me saying that that girl is her grandbaby and she acts just like me. She says she likes to draw, watch anime,((like every teenager born in the 21st century)) smiles, talks, and looks like me. She showed me pictures of her art, she was estatic. She said that althought the girl is in the system, she has a support system now. I always watned to scream. These people that completely abandonded me in foster care are going to help her! Where was that at when I was in foster care bouncing from home to home! I was so angry. I held my tounge. My grandmother started talking about me to the girl and said I was excited to meet her. I again said you should get a DNA test just to be sure!&amp;#x200B;Regardless of what your gut thinks, something could always be different. Plus, why put this girl through this thinking she may have another family and it turns out we are not her paternal family. So are they going to abandon her after they find out? My grandmother said I should see her and I declined. I said, ""I am not going to speak with her until I know for sure she is my sister, and even if she was my sister, why is that my responsibility to form a relationship with her when I don't have a relationship with my other siblings because of my fathers lack of control?"" She got quiet and we eventually ended the call.

10tuhjz,8,"I (20f) met this girl (17f) three years ago in a summer camp as volunteers. We had a lot in common and immediately hit it off. What surprised me was that the age difference was not actually a problem. We were both interested in books, the same kind of music... Of course, we had a lot to talk about and spent a lot of time together. Even after the camp we texted every day for almost a year. After that maybe once in two weeks and now it is maybe once a month. We would also meet maybe twice a year, as we live only half an hour from each other.Actually, I never considered us to be close friends. I spent more time with my friends from elementary school (even though we weren't studying at the same school anymore) than with her. Maybe it wasn't nice of me, but she was more of an acquaintance to me.As time passed, we both changed significantly. She is into metal music now and came to love horses. That's basically all she talks about now. I don't like metal and  for some reason, I am actually a bit scared of horses so I don't feel comfortable talking about them. In addition, she got bored of all the common interests that we used to have. So, our conversation usually consists of her sending me links for various metal songs and asking for my opinion or sending me pictures of horses, or just talking about something connected to it. On the other hand, when I try to tell her about something, she turns the conversation back to herself. In the end, I just nod and ask questions when she starts with her ""monologue"". I have told her multiple times that I am not knowledgeable or interested in these topics. But nothing changes.The problem is that she invited me to go out with her next weekend. I have already told her that I can't a few times last year, but she always asks again. I don't see a point in meeting up anymore. In my opinion, we both grew up and our interests changed completely and we are not compatible anymore. I have tried to give her hints (saying that I don't have time to meet a few times in a row or never being the first one to text) but nothing works. I am actually an introverted people pleaser so I couldn't bring myself to tell her directly and used these childish ways to imply that I am not really interested. I hoped that our friendship will naturally fizzle out.

10t8k0r,53,"To give you guys context, I am a fifteen year old boy. I have mild autism and can’t realistically get a job at the moment due to schooling. My mother and I live in a small apartment with her three other kids. They are my half siblings and get treated way better than I do. They always get the newest clothing, best devices etc. My father died when I was young. My mom remarried and had kids, and tragically my stepdad who was actually a great guy died two years ago. My mom has always been tight with money, It’s understandable, but we aren’t poor. She buys upgrades for everyones phones (but mine) every year. I keep my mouth shut because I always assume that she doesn’t have the money for me. I dont mind, im fine with my iPhone 8, (My little brothers old phone that’s cracked) its not activated like my other siblings but I can still play fun games. Back to the topic, I am very socially inept due to my disability and it’s hard for me to talk to people I dont know. I also have a hard time picking up on social hints. All my clothes are usually handmedown from my father or she buys from goodwill or a thrift shop. I don’t complain because it makes me feel closer to my dad sometimes. This all boils down to yesterday. Yesterday I went shopping with my family. During the whole trip I kept quiet like I usually do, I dont like speaking up much or asking for things because I understand my mom is tight with money. However, my siblings all got some new clothes and shoes, they got them from the nike shop. I didnt complain or ask for anything. When we went to Walmart for groceries, there were these really cool pair of halloween socks. I love halloween, it’s my favorite holiday. So I asked my mom for them. To sum everything up, she blew up at me in Walmart. Calling me ungrateful, saying she wish she’d never had me, calling me an asshole for asking for things I knew she wouldn’t buy. My siblings then started calling me an asshole and I began crying. I haven’t spoken with them today because I feel really bad.

10se02s,5235,"I'm a newly divorced dad of a 3 year old girl. I have her every other week.My daughter has very curly hair that my ex wife used to take care of. Now that I'm alone with her half the time, I have to figure it out. I try but on my weeks her hair was mostly a frizzy, tangled mess.A teacher at my daughter's daycare has very similar hair to my daughter's so I asked if she could help me with my daughter's hair. She said she could do my daughter's hair in the mornings if I dropped her off earlier (dropoff starts at 8, I usually drop her off at 8:45 but her teacher says if I drop her off by 8:20 she'll be able to take care of her hair). She gave me a list of curly hair products to buy and what to bring to school. She also gave me some tips for washing and caring for it at home.I guess my daughter told my ex that her teacher does her hair, not me, and that she goes to daycare early now because my ex called me and asked if I really drop her off a half hour early every morning just so I could ""avoid doing her hair"". She called me a bad parent for ""relying on a teacher to do my job"" and for messing up the morning routine so we could get to school early enough for the teacher to do her hair (we used to wake up, give her a bath, I'd attempt to do her hair, we'd have breakfast, then go to school but now we wake up, take a bath, and eat breakfast in the car).I thought I was doing right by making sure her hair is cared for on my weeks but my ex feels very strongly about this so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.Edit: I'm going to add some things to the post that I'm seeing in the comments. I am learning how to care for her hair. Her hair is healthier now than it was a few weeks ago. I have her hair down on the weekends because I still suck at styling it but it still looks good. The teacher really seems to enjoy doing her hair. I know she does other kids' hair but it's not exactly a set thing.

10tdglh,17,"So about two years back, my friend (24 at the time) texted me (would've been 26, F) to let me know they were coming through my city on their way to see their parents. I was super excited because I hadn't kept in contact with any other people from college, and there are reasons for that, but it was extremely isolating living in a state where I had nobody. This friend had been a pre-law student who took a gap year that just sort of turned into year-round bouldering. The last time I had seen them was right when they departed on their trip, and in hindsight, I should have remembered how badly that visit had gone, but I can't emphasize enough just how lonely I was. I was so looking forward to a little gossip, wine, maybe some trips to nearby attractions once I got off work in the evenings...At the time, I had a full-time job, and an apartment with a roommate whose relationship with me was tenuous. My one request of former roommate was basically, ""Don't let your boyfriend live here,"" and we had a huge falling out when she couldn't abide that.Point being, we weren't on super comf terms at any point while living together.So this friend--let's call them JT--texted me the day before they were supposed to arrive at the apartment and let me know they think they have a UTI. They also told me they'd stay for three days. Because of the UTI, we weren't really able to do anything aside from go to the grocery store, which is fine; it's just kind of weird to be stuck in a tiny apartment with a person you haven't spoken to regularly for years. But I did try. I asked if they needed a ride to urgent care and offered to pick up any food or drugs needed. The answer was always no.Around day 5, I started getting antsy. This is when I started to remember that JT had pulled this exact same stunt last time they visited, except then it had been an issue with a laptop that they needed resolved, and the visit ended up lasting almost two weeks.As I mentioned before, I was already not on great terms with my roommate due to HER ""visitor"" abusing his 5-consecutive-days limit. I still have anxiety about lease laws after unintentionally incurring a large fine against a friend when I was young and dumb. I bluntly expressed my fears to JT when they texted me while I was at work, asking why I'd been acting weird. The response was immediate and cold. They said they would go get a hotel room and just slide the spare key under the apartment door. I spoke with them while they were recovering (I think it took three more days?) and driving down to parents, just to make sure they got there safely, but have not heard from them since. They told me they had a bladder infection, and honestly, sometimes I wonder if that was just a lie to make me feel guilty for standing my ground.AITA for not allowing homeless friend to stay in my apartment indefinitely while they recovered?",AITA for kicking sick friend out of my apartment?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tdglh/aita_for_kicking_sick_friend_out_of_my_apartment/

I was worried, but he only had a temperature and flu symptoms. My partners sister called him telling him to call an ambulance because over 40 is deadly and he needs to go to hospital or he could die, this of course freaked my partner out and decided to go to the hospital which I put into the family group chat. My partner gets to the hospital and they are busy  they said not an emergency so there will be a few hours wait to be seen and if he wants to wait then he can but there's not much they can do, my partner stays in the hospital for 2 hours and hasn't been seen, he's feeling the same but not worse so he decided to go home, he puts it in the group chat to update everyone and his sister went off saying that his brain is going to boil, he could have seizures and die ect. And starts calling him names such as an idiot. This didn't sit right with me because my partner has insecurities about whether he is not as smart as everyone else and its something we've been working through but none mentioned anything or pulled her up on it so I decided to sleep it off to see if I was overreacting but the next morning it still didn't sit right with me so I replied to her saying 'hey I know you were worried about your brother but that was a bit much, I mean the situation was under control so it feels a bit uncalled for', this sent her in a rage and she started messaging me a wall of texts saying how he's her brother and I wasn't taking it seriously, I should know it's life threatening, she called him an idiot because she cares for him and I have no place saying how she talks to her brother, it was taken way out of context, how I shouldn't pick a fight with her over her caring for her brother ect.  I replied saying that I get she was stressed and I never intended to start a fight but that I won't not speak up about things that my partner mentions hurts him and only mentioned it because it does affect my partner.

I have to admit, since my father passed recently I've probably been a bit melancholy over my approaching birthday. It's my first time with no living parents, so i ended up accepting. Honestly, I tried to postpone it just before we left lol. This is what happened...6:30 We got there, ordered some drinks and some nachos and we're having a good ol time BSing. 7:00 Suddenly, some of my friends started showing up and then a few more. I was happily surprised! They all explained to me that the night before, they were invited to meet at 7:00 by my (ex SIL, ex's sister) who I'm very close to. But then the million dollar question...Where is (ex SIL)? One of my friends had called her before hand and she was ""on her way"", but that was an hour ago. 7:30 Roommate called and was told she was ""driving there right now"". 8:00 Roommate calls again and ""they're close"". We all had a nice time chatting and catching up, ordering food, everyone was buying me free drinks, ect. Well guys, 8:30 rolls around and my friends who all had previous engagements, which I knew btw, had started wrapping things up. I thought it was nice they were able to make the time to ""surprise me"" on such short notice to begin with. 8:45 (ex SIL) shows up with her new Husband and one of their buddies as I'm walking the last of my friends to their car. She said ""everyone is leaving, thought they'd hang out a few hours at least"", I said ""they did"". So she's gonna make up for it by ordering food and drinks. 9:00 I opened my gifts she brought. I enjoyed them and found them to be my personal taste which was very thoughtful. She took this to be a photo opportunity as she often does and I had a great time talking with her husband and their buddy, while trading her phone back and forth so photos could be taken.9:15 Her teenage son called, said he heard a noise and was scared. So she abruptly leaves with everyone she brought in tow. Her son (14, on the football team, is a foot taller, and 100 pounds heavier than me) does this a lot to get attention and it's usually handled with a lot less urgency.

They both felt unsafe living there and I also needed some help dealing with chores as I'm moderately disabled. I did not really know his GF too well but my cousin and I were practically brothers growing up (as my mom was the only one in the family that ever helped him when he was getting clean).When I asked him to move in, he did mention that he wanted to leave his GF behind. However, when he moved in, she was there. We lived together for 2 years and, while I would probably describe their relationship as toxic at best (mostly due to issues with her), she did decide to get help for her emotional problems and came back an entirely different person.My cousin, meanwhile, started to change after she got help. At first he was glad that he had ""the real her back"" but he started to act completely out of character for himself. Angry, combative, mean... also stopped eating anything except berries and lost at least 50 lbs over the course of a few months.Him and I had a big argument and that, along with his (once again) deteriorating relationship with his GF, caused him to move out. I didn't kick him out. I also said I would not kick HER out, despite him telling me to. Also, ex is in quotes because he will text her telling her how much he loves her one day then the next he'll say she's an evil woman who ruined his life.Anyway, since he's left, he's relapsed and blames me because I ""chose her over him"".While I didn't know his GF much before we moved in together, we became good friends and she has absolutely no family whatsoever.

10to4cv,6,"Me (M23), Bruce (M23), Larry (M23) and Mary (F23) went on a two-day trip I organized. We stayed at a bedroom I rent in a house. It's the first time we do something like this. For day two the plan was to go to a volcano, visit an old building (tourist attraction), visit a forest park, and then head to the apartment. I woke up everyone early because the bus to the volcano parted at 8 and the only other bus there was at 12. I warned Larry not to make breakfast and instead eat something on the road because of how little time we had. He didn't listen and we missed the first bus. We waited an hour to take a different bus to the old building instead. We had a good time at that place, and at 12 we took the bus to the volcano. On the bus we find out we needed to a reservation to enter, which was a surprise to everyone, even the other tourist on the bus. We canceled the visit, leave the bus in the middle of nowhere, and contacted a taxi to take us to the forest, which was expensive. We had wasted so much time we could only stay an hour in the forest. The bus back to the apartment leaved at 4. We hadn't eaten lunch at this point. I proposed to walk there, to which everyone agreed. As we head down the mountain, we realize we were barely going to make it, so I quicken my step thinking that if I made it in time, I could retain the bus for a couple of minutes until the rest got there. Midway there, I realized Larry did the same, and we had left Bruce and Mary a few kilometers behind. There wasn't any signal on our phones, so we couldn't communicate, but once a call went thru, Mary told us to take the bus without them because they had stopped to eat so they weren't going to make it. Once our phones had signal, we received angry text from Bruce. Larry and I eat at the house, and then started to get everything ready to leave. When Bruce and Mary arrived they didn't complain to us, but I still tried to explain why we had done what we did.Once we were ready to leave, Mary called an Uber. Before closing my room, I gave it a final check, and realize my cooking pot was missing. I all over the place until I finally found it, but the Uber still had to wait for like 8 minutes outside.Even though things didn't go according to plan, I though everyone had enjoyed it, until a few days later Bruce informed us that Mary was very mad at both me and Larry, and that she even said she didn't consider us her friends anymore.We only realized she was mad because Bruce told us (she didn’t talk to us) so we didn't even have a chance to apologies for what had made her mad. On the trip back she didn't show any signs of being angry and treated us normally.Both Larry and I recognize we did some things wrong, but she is cutting an 8 yearlong friendship without even giving us the chance to apologize.

So for a long time, I been good friends with this person. Essentially since high school until not in our 40s. Even during COVID we always kept a good amount of communication through social apps and when restrictions were clear, we began to hang out again as well with other friends.

Our usual social app communication through texting/phone calls became even more rare. Sometimes flat out ignoring me when I asked how they are doing.&amp;#x200B;So while ignoring me essentially every which way, I always tell them ""listen if you want to hang out, just reach out to me"". I would get confirmation with a ""sure will do"". Then on those rare moments where I have days off or there was a social gathering, I would not get invited to those. We have the same circle of friends so it becomes even more irritating that I am not included. How do I know? Because they all stream hanging out. We usually hang out together, all joining the stream in person. Those days seem long and gone now. So I decided to ghost them. Last week, they text me asking why I stopped texting them.

I’d always let him, at times having the kid stay at the flat with him, and me and my boyfriend, so he didn’t have to see his ex. Christmas time came and because of seasonal work his girlfriend (early 20s) stayed with me, I’m mates with her too. When he started to visit again he wouldn’t always let me know when he was coming and going from the flat and could be messy. He was like this when he lived with me but it had gotten worse. Sometimes when I told him I was coming back for lunch, he’d be in the living room, mess everywhere, room full of vape smoke trying to have a sleep and giving me looks whenever I was making noise making my lunch. It got to the point where I felt uncomfortable not knowing the comings and goings of my flat, I didn’t know what to expect when I got home, it felt like I couldn’t relax and he wasn’t changing. He called me strict and unfair and I said if he couldn’t respect it then he wasn’t welcome to stay anymore. I felt bad because his girlfriend was paying me rent for the seasonal period and was a great housemate, she said he understood the situation.He then paid for a hotel a couple of times when he next came to visit to see his girlfriend. He messaged me a couple of weeks later changing his tune because he wanted to stay at the flat again. He’d paid £50 towards the outstanding rent as a peace offering, he said he’d try to improve. I stood my ground and said I needed more time. His girlfriend’s colleagues ended up banding together to pay for a hotel room for them, at like £40, for new years so they could spend it together as he said he couldn’t keep visiting her because it was costing too much.AITA for making my friend pay for a hotel because I didn’t want him staying at my flat? As a side note, its recently turned out that he’d been having sex his baby mother a few times throughout the last year. When I tried to confront him about the lying and cheating he’s just kept bringing up instead how horrible I was over Christmas. That he’s made mistakes but I’m the bad guy because I wouldn’t let him stay with his girlfriend in the flat and that friends just wouldn’t do what I did…**Edit: The girlfriend knows about the cheating, the baby mother found her online and that’s how we found out about what he’d been doing, the girlfriend is currently choosing to stay with him.

10tt6ug,14,"So for background there is me (20m), my father (40m), my mother (39fm) and then my little brother (13m) we all live in a apartment togetherAs a kid my mom and I were quite close and we developed a tight-knit relationship due to her manipulating me to think my father is a scumbag (They are still together). She has turned my way of thinking into watching my dad to ensure he doesn't fuck up or upset her or hit her (he never has). So ever since I was a kid I've been severely mentally manipulated by her but during my late teens I started to understand get the full perspective My father was not abusive nor a asshole or a fuck up he was a supporting father who worked long hours to care for his sons and family. So since my father continues to work long hours to support our rent you would think my mother would support him with that endeavor like cleaning our making sure everything is looking good or maybe even relieving some pressure and also putting in hours  but not really, no. At maximum my mother works 10 hours a week cashiering whilst my father works around 100 hours a week cleaning and serving foodwhich is insane. Now I work around 40 hours a week in a very busy kitchen space which is quite stressful and is heavy handed at times. My father and I pay the bills and groceries,, I pay my extra bills as well plus my food and mother buys useless items to decorate the apartment. So that's some background to kind of understand our situation. Recently my mother has been just sitting on the couch gaming constantly with my little brother. Nothing around the house is clean she contributes nothing to the rent and all she does is complain about how the house looks and about gaming and how things need to be done, mind you my father and I are the main targets of this ""get shit done"" ordering around. I decided to speak up about her behavior and she immediately redirected it towards me and my little brother and her decided to harass me off the gaming console and constantly scream at me in my face about how it's none of my business.

10tpg8b,7,"My fiancé (30sM) and I (30sF) are getting married soon. We’re keeping it extremely low-key, basically one step above just going to the courthouse to do it. We’re doing that for a few reasons, the most important being 1) I have never wanted a big wedding and we both don’t want to spend the money on one (we’d be funding it), and 2) my mother is recovering from a stroke and suffering from some other neurological issues and we don’t want to overwhelm her.So for these reasons and more, we’re getting married very close to my family and keeping it to immediate family only. If we opened it up to extended family, the size of the whole thing would immediately quadruple, and we are literally just planning on doing the ‘ceremony’ in the back yard of an Airbnb so it hardly seems worth it for them to fly all the way out for (and we’d also suddenly have to coordinate hotels, a venue, catering, etc — all the things we’re trying to avoid). We’re going to plan a reception a few months later in his family’s home state and invite all of his extended family to that. That’ll give them and us a chance to celebrate together without them having to travel out of state. Many of them are elderly and wouldn’t be able to travel easily. However, there’s one exception to the immediate family only rule. We want to invite my fiancé’s godmother, who’s also his aunt, to the wedding ceremony. They’re extremely close and I think it would feel like we’re missing something by not having her there. Also, I think we kind of already disappointed his mom a bit by having such a small ceremony because my fiancé‘s extended family is pretty close and I feel like I’m depriving them of seeing their beloved nephew get married. This aunt is his mom’s sister—she is very close to my fiancé’s mom and never had kids of her own so my fiancé is basically like a son to her too. Would we be assholes for inviting her, given she’s the godmother? He was thinking of sending an email to the rest of the family explaining the situation (immediate family + god parents - he would invite his godfather too if he was still alive) and that we’ll celebrate with them in their home state later in the year. I don’t want the rest of the family to be offended that this one aunt is going while they’re not invited, and I know at least one aunt will indeed be offended. Would she be right to be offended?

10tq4ck,25,"I (22F) am graduating university this May. I'll be moving to another part of my country for a postgrad program in September. My current university is 3 hours away from my dad's (50M) house. I have spent the last two summers in my university town, one working and one doing a summer semester. This was partially because my family can be quite dramatic, and for mental health reasons I prefer to have some space, but they don't know that. Dad didn't approve of the summer semester, and felt I should be working full time.For the summer months, I was planning on continuing to work my part time job at a local small business while splitting rent for a small apartment with my partner (21M). The schedule there is flexible enough that I could take time off to go find apartments in my new city, and I could resign whenever I wanted to do the move instead of being stuck with a set completion date. Also, at this point my partner and I are still waiting to hear back from postgrad programs, and if it turns out we need to do long distance during the school year I would like to spend time with him during the summer. However, yesterday my manager told me that the business will be closing in the near future, so I need a new plan.I told this to my father, and lamented that this meant I have to find a full time summer job either at home or in my university town. He suggested that I just plan on coming home and working part time at a restaurant or grocery store, as (in his words) ""you could have a part time job tomorrow, they're all desperate"". The thing is, the last summer I was home, I tried to apply for these part time jobs and almost never heard back. It was only once I got an interview somewhere that I knew why: employers were deterred from hiring me knowing that I would be leaving soon to go back to school. I experienced the same thing last summer as I looked for part time work while I took my summer term, and was even passed over once for the job I currently have. So, I told him that I couldn't rely on that, as nobody wants to hire a student who can only commit for three months. This made my father surprisingly upset. He started ranting that I have an extremely poor attitude, I was making poor financial decisions, and that the reason nobody was hiring me is because I was being so negative and letting my mind get in the way. I tried to explain my previous experiences, how I felt I would have better luck getting a full time seasonal position, and that I would still apply for part time things, but he just said he can't talk to me like this and that he can't beat my mind. This, on top of finding out I was losing my job, was incredibly overwhelming. I vented to my partner when I got home, and he says I just shouldn't have told Dad because he only wants me to live at home. But is my attitude really that bad?

10towj6,43,"One of my [M] closest friends [M] just got engaged. We haven't known each other for too long in the scheme of things (~12 years) but we have been through a lot together. We shared a lot about life and how we view things. One of those discussions centered around marriage. His parents are divorced, mine are separated but not officially divorced. We're both anti-establishment in some ways and could not understand why two people can't be together forever without going through this process we call marriage -- both the official aspect of why the government needs to get involved in granting permission, and also the social aspect of why you need to put on this show. It's not like the bride and groom get to spend time with their guests much. I always hated going to weddings anyway and decided I'm not going to any more for the rest of my life. I shared this viewpoint with him (and pretty much everyone else in my life) and made it clear that there would be no exceptions. This was years and years ago. The last wedding I went to was around 2011 and now that I think about it, it was before I met him. I have not been to a single wedding since becoming friends with him.He started dating this girl about three years ago and got immediately smitten. She wants kids. If staying together with her means having kids, then he's going to have kids. Both of their families are very religious and conservative (GA and AL families) so having a child without being married is simply not acceptable. They are independent adults but there's the reality of appeasing the families. Therefore, they are now engaged as of last month. They're going to try to fast track the wedding so that they can get going on conception ASAP.My friend did not directly ask me but he did try to indirectly float the idea of me attending his wedding. I shut it down right away. Don't get me wrong, I do support them being together. After three years I think I can say I know his fiance fairly well now, and they make a great couple, would make great parents, and I do sincerely wish that they would stay together forever. In many ways, she is the best thing that happened to my friend. It simply is that I absolutely hate attending weddings. He then said how her closest friends will be in the party and it would mean a lot to him and also for her for me to be in his party. I responded by saying it would mean a lot to me to not do any of that. He then asked if I would just attend as a guest. I shut that down too.We haven't spoken about it since. I do have this sense that as their wedding planning kicks into gear, it's going to come up again. And I will refuse again. At this point I would feel like he's being unreasonable disrespecting my wishes I clearly indicated before he even knew this girl existed. AITA?edit: there are reasons I dislike weddings beyond my personal disapproval of it. it takes more than just a couple hours especially if the wedding is happening in a different state (in this case TN and I'm in NV), there are too many people and it dials up my social anxiety to 11. as for the 12 years thing, I said that because there are people I have known for much longer (going back to elementary school so that's like 30 years) and I didn't go to their weddings either but we still hang.",AITA for refusing to go to a friend's wedding?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10towj6/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_a_friends_wedding/
10tr633,15,"I (18F) and my best friend (17F) have been friends for almost a year now.  We are almost like platonic soulmates and know everything about each other.  We are basically the same person, but aren't.  I am a lesbian/nonbinary, she is a straight female who has her fair share of female crushes.  She is also dating her boyfriend (17M).  I'm gonna name them ""Hannah"" and ""Ryan"".  Not using real names.Hannah and Ryan have been dating for almost 1 year and 2 months.  I never truly liked Ryan because I didn't know him well, but I also liked him because he made Hannah happy.  But not in a good way.  They haven't kissed and just now started going on dates and holding hands.  I get going slow, but Hannah wants more from Ryan.They were both raised in strict, religious households, but Ryan doesn't have any social media and doesn't even have permission to watch youtube.  Hannah is allowed social media, her parents are just semi-strict religious parents.But it feels like every month there was a problem they had.  And just now, Ryan is starting to pick up things she's been hinting for a YEAR.I get both ways, but I keep telling Hannah that I don't think Ryan wants a relationship.  She's had to push him for anything and he doesn't even have a good relationship he's seen to try and be a boyfriend to Hannah.Ryan has hid things from her that she had to hear from Ryan's mother.  Ryan is an AP kid who is focused on school and college and a job.  He barely has time for her.  I think Hannah is being disrespected.I understand where they're both coming from because they've both talked to me about their lives.I am becoming distant from Hannah because I believe she's being treated unfair.  I tried to warn her, but I don't want to se her get hurt and I don't want to continue to be a friend towards someone.Also, I was in a relationship and it was EXACTLY like Hannah and Ryan's.

I forgot to add.  Hannah and I were super close, but when she started dating Ryan she completely pushed me away.  And then when things got rough, came back to ME only in times to text me about how he did something and how she wanted to break up with him.  I told her to break up with him and that I thought he was toxic.  Not only did I say it, but 10 OTHER PEOPLE told her.  But she says he's just ""not used to relationships"".  She only hung out with me when she wanted to complain about him.  I don't think its toxic, I now toxic, I just think them together is toxic because he doesn't care about her and when we try and tell her to leave him and I will be there for her when she does, but she won't because she doesn't want to be sad even though she's sad now.  I've tried being there for her, I just have my own school and mental things and want a friend who wants to be friends with me, not just complain to me and when I try to help tells me I'm wrong.  And also says everyone else is wrong as well.&amp;#x200B;Another edit: sorry, i'm truly trying to find peace between my friend and i.  i want to add i just want her to be happy, but she knows ryan doesn't like her. a text from 6 months ago, she texted her saying ""i don't want to be in  relationship, i'm focused on school.""  and they had a big fight.  ryan barely notices her and doesn't even text her.  when she tried to bring something up to her, he ignored her for a week then sent a ""good morning"" text a week later.i am STILL with my friend and should've put ""WIBTA"" not ""AITA"", i just want to know how to fix this because we are kids and i just want to graduate with no drama.  her grades are falling and i just want her to be happy.  she was never there for me, so i tried being their for her and tried to make ryan look good, but some friends have evidence that he isn't the best.  i don't just ""wanna be her friend again"" i want my friend who was happy and cheerful back, not someone who rants to me, ask for help then when i try to help like ""text him about this"" she says he wont listen.  i only just now started sharing the ""maybe it's time to talk to him about important things and what you two want"", but other friends have tried too or tried to talk to both of them.  she continues to text him even though he ghost her.  i try to invite her places to get her mind off of it, but she says she's waiting for ryan.  i usually leave it alone, but i can't PUSH her to hang out with our friends.i'm not really trying to figure out if someone is an AH, it just sort of helps me figure this out.",AITA For Being Distant Towards My Friend?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tr633/aita_for_being_distant_towards_my_friend/
10uipyr,65,"I (NB24) commented on a fic that while I love darkfic and while I respected the sufficient warning and while it was technically well written, it seemed needlessly cruel without an actual purpose or theme for the reader to interpret, and that I didn't get the point of the story, and that it missed the mark entirely. I said it fell flat and that I was really disappointed, because I love the author's other works.The writer called me an asshole for making uncalled-for comments. I think that what I said wasn't rude, just blunt. I don't know how to explain to someone that they did a terrible job without it being an insult, and I think the poor reaction was just because the writer didn't want to hear their fic wasn't good.

Hate is of course not OK but it seems that every encapsulation of I Don't Like This is seen as innately negative and rude and I don't get it.Fandom is supposed to be welcoming, but the inability to leave honest comments is a form of censorship; it's ableism to police comments as only being allowed when written in an NT manner. I think there needs to be more leeway for people who can't express themselves in a stereotypical, NT customer-service rep way. I think everyone should be more lenient when interpreting comments on their works -  why frame everything that isn't literally coddling, overprotective, and humoring as hate? Not being able to leave honest comments is actively exclusive of people who struggle with tone and I don't think ND people should have to learn to fix ourselves to be accepted.The author didn't even address any of the valid points I made, just yelled at me for saying it in the wrong way instead of coddling their feelings.

Neither myself nor my partner have ever met either of these partners. My fiance and I drew up two invitation lists ages ago, one with 30 people on it in case of covid restrictions (C was on this list), and one with about 120 people (including both of C’s partners).Once we found a venue and decided a budget, we had to finalise a list of 90 people. We decided that unless we know somebody well and consider them one of our friends, we wouldn’t invite them. So all the partners we didn’t know well came off, including some people we HAVE met. We knew that this is against wedding etiquette but it just didn’t feel right to spend £100 per head on people we don’t know at the expense of our loved ones. I had assumed that people would understand that this was about money, and not a personal thing, so we didn’t consider telling people in advance. In all cases other than C, this assumption has proved correct; no one else has mentioned there being a problem. I also assumed that C would be more offended by having one partner picked than neither, and we definitely couldn’t afford to invite both. Invitations arrived this week. One of my other bridesmaids, N, got hers first. N’s partner is our videographer so he is on the invitation but he isn’t quite a guest. N posted a pic of her invite in the group chat. C must have seen this and assumed that partners were invited. The next day I had a message from C asking for clarification if either of their partners were invited. I explained that we would love to have had them there, but that we couldn’t afford it and that it was just a blanket rule. C is very upset with me. They said that they felt humiliated not having either partner invited and that I put them in a horrible position when they opened their invite in front of their partners and then had to explain why neither of them were on it. C has also pointed out that they are disabled and that this should have been considered. We have made sure to choose fully accessible venues. As far as I know, C does not use a wheelchair and they are largely independent, but I should still have discussed this with them. I have done my best to explain, and I have apologised profusely for the fact that I didn’t mention it in advance. C has said that they don’t want to fight and we are having a productive conversation. C has said that choosing one partner to bring wouldn’t have been a problem and that I should have just asked them about it. I know I’m stupid for not just talking about it beforehand.

The thing is he isn't, me and my siblings are all second generation immigrants and I just never took much interest in Korean culture, they however became obsessed with it at a young age. I just didn't engage much. Since it's not that important to me I never told my bf about any customs or what is and isn't appropriate to them. He's kind and nice to them, its just that he's not Korean or even Asian.I kept pushing to bring him and I kept being told no, so I said that if he isn't coming then I'm not either.

10to29a,11,"The most important piece of context you need for this story is that I (19M) am an animation student. I saved up to get a graphics tablet and my own pc, and it's proved an invaluable asset in my time at uni. Without this setup, to get any of my work done, I'd need to take a 30 minute bus ride down to my campus, and hope and pray that the animation suite wasn't booked out for a lecture - they don't publish that information online. I'm only on campus three days a week - going more would add an extra £14 to my weekly costs, which when I have medication and software subscriptions to pay for, isn't exactly ideal. In addition, I take commissions, some of which are of the uh.. *naughty variety*, which would *really* awkward to work on in a busy classroom setting. In short, working on my own PC saves me money and time and is more comfortable as a whole.  My friends and I applied to live in uni halls again next year, as most good private accoms had been snatched up already. Only two of us have gotten our accomodation offers so far, and although we were placed together, I had a huge issue with the *desk*, which was attached to the wall in the corner of the already small room, making it a triangle shape that I knew on immediate glance would *not* fit my monitor, keyboard and graphics tablet. This was an absolute dealbreaker in my eyes.I, on impulse, asked the accomodation team if I could move to the first type of room I requested, which was the same as my current uni room - even if that meant not living with my selected people. My other friend who also recieved a room offer agreed that it wasn't ideal and sympathised with my decision to request another room. I'm yet to recieve a response because it's the weekend, but I'm beginning to think that this may have been an asshole move. My boyfriend and I have only been together for four months, and he wanted to live in the same flat as me. I agreed to this, but upon reflection, I'm not quite ready to *fully* live with him. I'm introverted, and I've never been in a relationship before, and I think putting a bit of space between us is something I need right now. It's a very ""it's not him, it's me"" type of situation. We'll still be in the same student village, it'll be a 2 minute walk to see him at the *most*. He has yet to recieve his room offer, so there's no guarantee he's even in the same building yet.  We had talks about that being a possibility, as we applied rather late, and he said he didn't mind as long as we were closer than we currently were. I love him and I'd love being closer to him, but my social battery runs dry very quickly.TLDR: I requested to change rooms as I felt the small desk in the room wouldn't fit all my animation equipment on it. This will likely result in me not living in the same building as my boyfriend.

So this is my first doing this recap and to be fair, they never said how they wanted us to write our recaps. I’ve taken a look at other trainer recaps and they are very minimal in terms of explaining what they did that day. So I decided that I wanted to write a descriptive and clean email that should be easy to read but did take a bit of time to write. I didn’t think too much of it but short after I sent my email, one of our managers replies to my email saying that I did a “fantastic job” and that “all trainers should follow my format.” The next day, I have trainers complaining to me that what I did was too extra and so we come to here.

No collar, no chip, no pictures on missing websites.Although she didn’t get along with my other cat(sadly had to put him down on thanksgiving ) they learned to be cordial and she opened up,I’ve never met a cat as affectionate and loving ,she genuinely won’t sleep unless laying on top of me.I was taking my dog on a walk and this guy stopped me started a conversation, he owns this kitten that frequently follows me and I told him I also have a cat. I send him a picture and apparently it’s his sisters?

He confided in us a lot during the divorce&amp;in a moment of defending him, I think I said something I shouldn’t have. I don’t remember saying anything but it’s possible. His exes family would make up outrageous lies about him&amp;it would fire me up, I could’ve said something I shouldn’t have but it was in a genuine manner. Not in a “talking crap” way. That being said, he has barely spoken to us since he got a new gf, it always like that. He’s only friends with us on his terms. Which is when he doesn’t have a woman in his life. (Before incident)Mac&amp;hubby went deep sea fishing when our baby was 4m so we decided to take a trip together. It was HORRIBLE! They barely spoke to us. We would try to talk to them at dinner &amp; his gf would ignore us&amp;whisper in mac’s ear. I had to leave to work for a couple hours&amp;instead of staying&amp;going to the beach with them, my husband&amp;baby went w/ me bc of how dinner went. Since then he hasn’t spoken to us much. But when he was single he was at our house EVERYDAY to hang out. Called/text both of us, individually, if the other didn’t respond. We truly didn’t mind.My husband had dinner with Mac&amp;he told him that he had been avoiding us because of something I had said. Said that he knew I didn’t mean to hurt him&amp;whatever I said was definitely genuinely meant, not derogatory. Husband told me. I tried to call 3x, text him w/ no response. Finally after a week he sent me a long message saying he forgave me for his &amp; my hubbys friendship sake, that I shouldn’t have called 3x,&amp;that if I wanted to speak to him, it needed to be in a group message with him, his gf&amp;my husband. That it made him uncomfortable&amp;that if it didn’t upset my husband that’s fine but he wanted to do it that way. (For background he would always text me privately, not in a group and call me if my husband didn’t answer&amp;text me to talk about the divorce&amp;see if we all could hang out.) &amp;that my message “hope you can make it to our daughters party!”&amp;happy holiday texts only saying “you” purposely left his gf out.

10tneci,12,"Sorry in advance. On mobile and it's a long one.I(30sF) am the only child of my parents. My dad has some kids from his first marriage, but I'm my mom's only child. Parents got divorced when I was 10. Lived with my mom, but they had joint custody and my father was very active in my upbringing.I grew up in a small town in Texas. My gma(mom's mom) lived in the same town, and my mom's siblings lived nearby. I spent a lot of time with gma growing up since I was left alone a lot with both parents at work. Despite their proximity, I was never close to this side of the family and preferred holidays with my dad. Mom and gma are very... attention seeking? Everything has to be the best, it's all about appearances, I was raised to be seen not heard and to be the perfect accessory.Fast forward to me being 18. I apply to out of state colleges since my relationship with mother was rocky at best and I wanted to get away. Load up my car and Dad drives me to the East Coast. I come home regularly for breaks, but spend more time with my father because mom doesn't like that I've ""left her all alone"" and I was over her childish behavior. Started going LC with her, as she berated me constantly on my life ""choices""(I'm a big gay), as well as coming to terms with the emotional abuse I grew up thinking was normal parenting.Right after Thanksgiving break one year, my mom has a massive stroke. I drop out of college to care for her, since I had power of attorney at the time. Her family visited once the first month she was in the hospital- the night she got admitted. My dad's family(keep in mind they've been divorced 10 years at this time)rallied around me and we would stay with her in shifts, they helped me with paperwork and getting her into good rehab spots.About the time my mother is becoming more alert, gma convinced mom to give gma power of attorney, essentially ruining all the work I did with paperwork, etc. Gma blows through my mom's insurance money on herself then sticks my mom in a nursing home to rot with no rehab, nothing. At this time I decide to go NC with mom, gma, and the rest of them. Gma is verbally and emotionally abusive to me and mom, and mom just spits out whatever gma says back to me. So for my own mental health I more or less wiped my hands clean of the entire situation. Gma finally died late last year. That side of the family reached out- power of attorney went to my uncle, mom's younger brother. But they're worried about his health and what would happen if he died... I told them that wasn't my problem. My dad's family has brought up over the years that I should reconnect with my mom, but I have zero interest in doing so. But now, with gmas passing, I have been thinking about it a lot.

10svd3d,131,"I was at a heavy metal gig with a group of friends last night, in a medium sized venue. I was lucky enough to be right at the front. Now, as you might be aware, right at the front of the stage is not the place in the venue with the most space. People weren't exactly crammed in, but were definitely close together. Now, me and my friends were closer to one side of the stage rather than the middle, and there was some more space closer to the wall but not where we were standing.So anyway, there was a woman who decided that this was a great location to headbang. She had hair down past her shpulders, and was bent over, properly giving it her all. She was right behind me, and kept headbutting me and hitting me with her hair - she was also hitting other people in front of her with her hair but continued to headbang. Because of how closely the crowd was standing together, I was unable to move further away from her and since I had a spot at the front, I didn't want to move back. I think it's worth mentioning that nobody else was headbanging like this, because there just was not space. Everybody was vigorously nodding - and this one woman bent over at 90 degrees headbanging.I had had enough of this after the first 10 minutes but I waited until the band had finished because I didn't want to be a total arse and talk to her while the band was playing (a 1 hour set) to ask her to please not headbang like that when standing in such a crowded area and that she clearly had no consideration for the people standing near ber, because she would be able to tell that she was hitting them. She got really angry, and said I wasn't entitled to speak on behalf of the other people in the vicinity. The people in the vicinity agreed with me that being headbutted by her wasn't really fun for them.The woman stormed off, clearly in a huff. My friends were split on it, some saying that she was being inconsiderate and others saying that obviously there would be headbanging at a heavy metal gig.So what is the verdict?

I told her to come over to discuss it, butwhat I heard from her is that she was trying to change it thatshe was ""only questioning and that it was just a question""which angers me even more to the point I'm yelling at her andarguing with her, and she's trying to break it up to evade thethe situation, when I told her that, that statement is offending me because first off, she asked me 2 times about what I'm watching and gave her my clear answer 2 times as well.The fact that it was almost our bedtime when this happened,so it was pretty clear she was trying to break up the situationto leave already, and she apologised.Now I was still frustrated after she left, and I did something to calm down my senses, and out of the blue, my sister (23) warned me menacingly next room...so now..she's trying to warn me in an angry tone to not do that when I did it to calm down, am I supposed to like what?

I'm suffering from lots of mental illnesses, and I'm not going to lie my days now are just drained from happiness because of exams, but I still try my best to be the best friend I could and be there for them. However, I don't know if this is a disorder, but I suffer from regulating my emotions. I hardly feel anything for anyone nor anyone apart from my family, and honestly I'm finding myself slowly loose emotions for them as well.Now onto the problem,A few days ago, while K, N and I were talking, and I was informed that N did some sort of betrayal, and I know it's not my place so I kept quiet and joked it of by telling N that what she did wasn't right but left it as that. I wasn't rude, nor was I mean, but N was upset and said that she doesn't like the fact that I told her that I don't like her, nor do I consider her a friend.I was shocked, because a few days into a friendship I explained to them that I have this thing where I am uncapable of feeling emotions, and that I don't consider anyone my friend because to me it feels unfair to call someone a friend when I don't feel anything for them, but I did explain that I do enjoy their company and enjoy talking and hanging out with them. All three of them understood.I have always been a supporitive and caring friend, so I was a bit confused and explained to N once more that she shouldn't take it personally because I'm like that with everyone. I even pointed at K and K had no problem because she understood perfectly about my lack of emotions, and that because of my lack of emotions, it's hard for me to genuinely like someone. And while defending myself I listed out two other friends whom are irrelevant for this story, including W.Now here's the part where everything went downhill, N calmed down and we were back to normal, but a friend of W was there and heard that I stated that I don't like W and I don't consider her a friend. I did say that, but it was out of context, if W's friend was paying attention he'd know that I was listing off the people I struggle to genuinely like and that W is just on the list.In the end W and I are on good terms, but now I feel like an asshole because maybe if I had just shut my mouth instead of explaining myself, maybe this could have been avoided?Also sorry if this is too confusing, I'll gladly answer any of your questions! &lt;3",AITA for tell my friend I don't like her?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tn3d0/aita_for_tell_my_friend_i_dont_like_her/

Now that I have settled in the new country I am trying to make a life of my own. I am currently pregnant and I just got myself a car as I just learned how to drive as I couldn’t afford it before. I am also taking part time studies so I can grow further in my current workplace which they are paying for half of my career as part of the benefits they offer. My mother and my sister don’t work as they say is hard to find reliable transport and it is more expensive to go to work than actually working. I also have to send extra money for any other family member almost every month because they are struggling and “need a hand”, the money in total I send every month is about 20% of my monthly wage. I have spoken to my mom and said I don’t want to help anymore because it has become a burden where I have to pick up extra shifts in order to keep supporting them. When I told my mom I will only supply 2 months more so they have time to find a viable way of living she was ok at first but on the same day I have the rest of my family calling me out as selfish and that they will not be able to make it without my help.

While a few frequent visitors will bring a party pack on occasion to contribute to the tray, mots people do not and I am okay with that.Enter coworker (of equal level) John, who visits almost every day and has not yet contributed (but again, it's not expected). Recently John brought up his favorite snack - a specific type of flavored pretzel - and how he wished I had them on the tray. At first I thought he was kidding around, making small talk, or even throwing out a real suggestion; though, the snacks are difficult to find and pricier than I'm willing to go for communal snacks. Over the last few weeks, John ramped it up and has mentioned those pretzels a majority of the time he has stopped by. While I never gave an indication I would try and get them, I also never clearly rejected the idea - maybe I should have?Finally, John came in and gave what I perceived as a serious, non-joking complaint about the lack of pretzels (keep in mind he does this while eating the snacks I put out for free to which he has never contributed). I boiled over a bit and told him that if he wanted the pretzels, he should bring them himself for the tray or pay me to go get them. I tried to maintain a smile and pass it as half joking, but I admittedly said it a bit sternly and, while he didn't say anything, he seemed uncomfortable after.AITA for getting upset with a coworker who pestered me about the selection of free snacks I was putting out?",AITA for scolding a coworker?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10suiyn/aita_for_scolding_a_coworker/

For example: Rainbow fish, goodnight moon, I’ll love you forever, the very hungry caterpillar etc. They were just books that i thought most everyone from the USA knew as they were popular during my childhood. Nick said he had never heard of any of them, which I thought was crazyThis morning MIL called us at 9am(we were still in bed) asking if we would be offended if she continued to buy our baby girl clothes and stuff when she shops. MIL tends to overthink and has a lot of anxiety in general(diagnosed) and was asking because she sent me a picture of a sweater she bought(which not that it matters but it was a 6-9month boys sweater light blue with trucks on it. We’ll still have our daughter wear it) I had responded by saying “that is cute! I’m excited for all the baby clothes look what I bought” and showing her an outfit that I just purchased. She got anxious that since I didn’t say anything else about the sweater that I wasn’t okay with her buying things or had an issue with that sweater in particular. That’s why she called. We reassured her she’s good. She told me to keep buying the cute girly outfits and she’ll buy the outdoor play outfitsNick brought up how we made a registry and she asked me to send it to her mentioning that FIL might help with some big things and she’s excited about the small things. That’s when I mentioned the books. I told her that I put all the classic childhood books on there and was surprised that Nick didn’t know any of them and that we’re definitely going to buy themMIL instantly got offended saying not to believe “Nicks crap about how he didn’t have a good childhood” because of course she read him books but they played outside more and how I can ask anyone in the family and they’ll confirm that she was the best mom. She went on for a few minutes and in my opinion there were plenty of moments where she gave Nick an opening to just say yeah I did have a good childhood, and the whole thing would have ended right there. I was quiet and he didn’t say a thing and she hung up sounding like she was crying. As soon as she hung up I texted her saying Nick and I realize the only reason I remember the books is that I have more siblings so the books were in my house for close to 15 years whereas he’s an only child She sent Nick a text asking if he really thinks he had a bad childhood and how she did her best. Nick got mad at me saying I never should have brought it up and look what I’ve done. How I turned him into the bad guy just because he told the truth. I feel like he could’ve stopped it by just saying “no I don’t think I had a bad childhood” at any point but he thinks it’s my fault knowing how his mom gets anxious.

Since the age of 10 or 11 I always wished that people would just leave me alone that day and pretend nothing happened, just like a normal day. Never asked or waited for presents or organised a party, it just never was important for me.Yet every single time my family would literally drag me to celebrate with them, throwing literal tantrums when I said I wanted the day to be ignored. It's almost a tradition that every year about a week before the date my fam asks me how I want to celebrate, I say I don't and then we fight for about four hours and I leave defeated. They never agreed to let it pass in peace.I understand that when I was a minor it could've been a way to show their care for their child, they used to say ""adults are always right"". But now that I'm an adult myself and moved out long time ago, they keep insisting I come and invite my friends. All that with a little twist: my parents are divorced since I was 8 and each half of the family wants me to celebrate with them specifically.Thankfully my friends have some respect for my wishes so they never mention my birthday. I also have a boyfriend and I would really prefer to just celebrate VD with him as normal people without my family causing a fuss.So what happened is that my father and I had a huge argument last night about this year's celebration. I said I don't think it should even be celebrated or noticed at all because it's my decision, he said it's his celebration too as he's the parent. I got annoyed and suggested that if it's the parents' celebration then why won't he invite his ex-wife and throw a party. He called me an asshole and said that the celebration will happen anyways and I must be there unless I want to ruin my relationship with the entire family.I'm certainly kinda frustrated because of this, these people never listen to me when I tell them to stop and leave me alone.

10toeuj,11,"So I have been best friends with T for a decade, and over the years B (all 21F) got into the group. I was always the most active friend, proposing to hang out. B was always ready to hang out, and T was more introvert. However, with covid, T's anxiety got so bad that she was afraid to even meet up just the three of us. I do realise the pandemic got us in different ways.It got so bad that T missed my (small) birthday in 2021, but we still hung out just the two of us the day before so I knew she was trying.Then in 2022 she was basically absent from any hangout with B and me, she would just tell us she didn't feel like it. I tried many times to reach out to her to try and undertand if she had something going on, and she always replied that everything was fine. I tried not to push.Then my birthday in 2022 came up, and as I was organising a small dinner at my place, I obv invited T and B. But then a week before my birthday she texted me telling me she was sorry and she couldn't make it because she didn't feel like being around people. And I replied that I couldn't force her of course, but I was quite sad that she would miss it and I wouldn't lie to her. She replied that she understood completely (but she didn't even propose to hang out just the two of us). I was always the one initiating a conversation, so I decided to wait for her to text me first. For some reason neither B texted her but we kept hanging out.And after some months of silence, T texted B asking if she was mad at her, which B replied that no, she was not mad and neither was I. She even told T to contact me since I would be happy about it (which is true). Still no text.So I texted her how I thougt she would text me first but she proved she didn't really care about our friendship. I do believe I was quite diplomatic (subjective ofc). She replied with some harsh things, telling me I was a manipulator and that at the time she was going through a tough patch and didn't want for me to know about it because apparently I spill everyone's business around. I felt so guilty at first so I asked her to tell me the times I've behaved in that way (to understand and be better), but her reply was that ""I haven't done it, but still I would do it"" -- so I realised it that was just a mean thing to say to me.She then accused me and B to form an alliance in order to outcast her and not inviting her to hang out anymore, for which I replied that we have never behaved in a way to hurt her, but of course if she isolates herself and we have just supported her behaviour, she has nobody else to blame but herself. If she was struggling (and I believe she was) she could have reached us and tell us, because we cannot read minds.

10qxv7b,1088,"I (F33) lost my husband very unexpectedly 7 years ago. We knew each other from a very young age and married when we graduated college. I have known his family for almost my entire life and they are the closest I have to actual family (my own family situation has always been difficult ). I became very close with his parents in particular (I will still call my ""in laws"" in this post) and we supported each other heavily through the grief process. We didn't have children before he passed, but we were trying. I still miss my husband every day.I began slowly dating again 4 years ago - mostly casual dates and nothing serious. In laws were broadly supportive. I told them I was ready to date and they said OK, but didn't want to know the details. I only ever spoke about my dating life vaguely and infrequently to them.Around the same time, I got a big promotion and began to spend a couple months a year in Paris for work (pandemic permitting). Then 1 year ago, I met Armand (M38) and started my first serious relationship since being widowed. Given Armand lives in Paris, our relationship is based there and while we have travelled quite a lot together, we haven't been to the US together yet. He hasn't met my in laws, but I have told them I am dating someone.Around Christmas, we found out I was pregnant. This was a total surprise as we weren't trying. We have since decided that I will move to France permanently instead of splitting my time between the US and France, so that we can raise a family together. It isn't really possible for Armand to move to the US - he works in the art industry and his studio and backers are all Europe based.I told my in laws and they were deeply upset. They said I was depriving them of their only opportunity to have a grandchild (my husband was an only child). They then accused me of moving on too quickly and not loving my husband. In the end, we had a huge argument and they have demanded that I leave all my husband's belongings from our apartment (his clothes, personal effects, etc) to them when I move to Paris. They also demanded my engagement ring, which is a family heirloom. They said they should have these because while I have moved on, he will never stop being their son.I said no, these things are all treasured memories from my life with him that I never want to forget. They have threatened legal action to recover the ring in particular. I'm not sure they have a proper legal right. But I can see the hurt I'm causing them with my choices and maybe giving them what they ask for, they will be able to have closure. AITA for continuing to refuse?&amp;#x200B;**EDIT 1. In response to comments:*** After the funeral, I already gave many of my husband's possessions to my in laws. What I kept were some clothes that reminded me of happy times, things with his handwriting on it, memories from trips, etc. I want to keep these. It's not like I will be lugging a huge amount of things to Paris. I don't think it's unreasonable that I keep these. They're memories WE made, not with his parents.* The ring is trickier... but it is the biggest reminder to me of the relationship we once had. It really breaks my heart to give it away.**EDIT 2.** Wow, I really didn't expect to wake up and see so many comments. Thank you all who shared their thoughts. A few clarificatory points in response to messages I've received (both posts below and DMs):* A poster below pointed out it was worth clarifying that I don't have a separate wedding band. We couldn't find one we liked and which matched the ring, so my engagement ring is also my wedding band, which my husband put on my finger in the church.* I really don't want to lose the relationship with my in laws. They have always been so kind to me (before this all happened) - for example, I've been spending every major holiday like Christmas, etc, with them for the past decade. But neither do I want to bend to their unreasonable behaviour. Moving to France and going completely silent isn't an option, I do want to repair the relationship in the long term. Ultimately, I'd love them to visit us. * The argument happened over the phone as I have been in Paris since we found out about the pregnancy and I didn't want to delay telling them the news. I am due to fly back for a month or so to get my affairs in order soon. I intend to meet them in person then, if they agree.* A few posters were concerned about what Armand thinks, which is very kind of them. Armand and I have a strong relationship and he has known about my husband since the beginning. He respects that I want to keep a piece of the marriage with me and has encouraged me to bring anything I want over to help with the transition. We are also not engaged, nor do I expect to be in the immediate future, and I'm in no rush on that front. We're comfortable as we are.* Finally, there were some concerns over if I use the ring. I do wear the ring frequently and it's the only ring I wear with any regularity. Someone also suggested that I might need to sell the ring in the future for the benefit of my new family.

10v6dbd,69,"My husband has a daughter with another woman who was conceived during a time when our relationship was open. We only found out about her when my stepdaughter was 3 and her mother has been a headache to deal with from the start. She’s even gone so far as to encourage my stepdaughter to behave badly whenever she’s at ours.We have her one weekend a month but my husband was going to be away on a business trip when she was supposed to be with us. I decided it would be for the best if my stepdaughter stayed with her mother instead of with me while my husband was gone for several reasons. Her behaviour is a lot worse whenever my husband isn’t around as she doesn’t think she has to listen to me and she’s extremely rude to our nanny. Our oldest and her constantly fight which isn’t something I wanted to deal with. Lastly, her mother has made it clear in the past that she doesn’t want her daughter left alone with me so I thought this was the perfect solution that would keep everybody happy.My husband was fine with it and he informed my stepdaughter’s mother. That Friday, I only asked our nanny to collect my son from school as I assumed her mother would collect her since she would be staying with her. She wasn’t picked up on time and her mother called me furious that we left her there. She tried to make me go and collect her but I refused so now she’s accusing me of trying to isolate her daughter from her siblings, and for being a nasty stepmother.

10v6rmr,72,"A lot of elements here. Please ask for info if needed. My fiance Matthew is constantly telling everyone that I hog the entire bed and that he has all of 6 inches of bed to sleep on every night. Claims he got no sleep because of me. He doesn't say it maliciously but it's become the butt of the joke and gets brought up often. Now the thing is, it's a bold faced lie. I'm an insomniac and during the night I wake up at least 3 times, if not more, and every single time I wake up I'm pushed all the way to the edge of the bed to a point of my legs being half off because he takes up the entirety of the rest of the bed and is right on top of me practically. Countless times I've woken up to his arm over my face, his legs up over me, etc while I'm basically dangling off the bed with no blankets. So not only are his stories a lie but it's the complete opposite of what he tells people. Other element, my fiance hates having his picture taken. Any time I try taking a picture of him he will tell me to stop. We have been together 5 years and we have maybe 3 pictures together. I think his most recent photos on social media are from like 6-7 years ago. He just hates it. It does bother me because I'm the opposite. I take a lot of pictures. Not of myself but if everything else. Places we go, friends, our animals, etc. I love pictures (I'm also a photographer) and I don't post these photos anywhere. They are simply for me to look back at as fond memories. But he hates it either way and I eventually stopped trying to photograph any memory of him because of how bad it pissed him off and having him make me feel stupid about it (him calling me pretentious or ""cliquey"" for taking so many photos). But after he started lying to everyone about the sleeping issues and making out like it was all me and that he's not sleeping, etc, I started taking pictures of him sleeping to show him how untrue this is. Yesterday he made a comment about me sleeping up his ass all night. I knew it was a lie because I had woken up at 3am and he was practically on top of me and I ended up getting out of bed and staying up. So I showed him the pictures I had taken over the course of the week and told him he can stop lying and making out like I'm the problem when it's him. He immediately got pissed and said I violated his privacy and a few pictures don't prove anything. AITA?ETA: I didn't do it as a petty revenge scheme. I did it to prove to him that he is making it all up so he would stop lying to everyone every single time we talk to people because I'm getting tired of being the butt of the joke and it being talked about constantly. I can't even hang out with mutual friends anymore without several of them bringing up the fact that I ""don't let him sleep"".

However, the pay isn't very good, I believe he said it was £4.81 even though it's the minimum wage for someone his age in the UK. He’s now nagging me to put a good word in for him at my current place.For context, about 4 months ago I got hired at a supermarket that paid well and the pay was above minimum wage. So everyone got paid equally, only it varying if you’ve worked at the store more than 3 years. I work at a branch closest to our home. A month later, he applied for a store assistant position at the same supermarket as me. His application was well done, and I was proud of him for taking a step forward. He was emailed not too long later to come in for a group interview. He was excited and booked the interview for that week.But later I found out that family members cannot work in the same branch from my manager. I told him this and explained he could still work for the supermarket just at a different branch. The 2nd closest branch was just a little further away, but you could still easily get there by bike or bus. For some reason, this information really pissed him off and I tried to get him to calm down. As he continued to rage on about it, he insulted my manager of the branch I work at and the area manager of our town. He screamed that I should move branches so he could work at the one I was at. I explained that was impossible because I was still being trained, but I had also just gotten to know everyone at this branch. I had already settled in. I decided to leave it at that. The day of the group interview comes, and he didn’t go saying he didn’t want to travel to a different branch. I didn’t say anything else other than, he couldn’t apply for the supermarket for another 6 months now.Fast forward to now, I’ve worked for this supermarket for 4 months now and I have no intention on leaving this job or branch for a while. My brother doesn’t like his pay and has been talking about it none stop. He keeps nagging me to put in a good word for him and I keep saying no, explaining he shouldn’t have insulted the people he could have potentially worked for.

10v9bup,39,"My wife [29F] and I [31M] recently had a baby, and we’re lucky that it’s been a delightful 2 months since. Unfortunately my uncle passed recently. My uncle was instrumental in my upbringing; he looked after me 3 evenings a week for ~10 years old, encouraged the hobby which eventually became my career, and was all around a wonderful man. I felt I had to go to the funeral. It pained me to travel 1000 miles so soon after my child was born, but I talked it through with my wife and we agreed a plan. I flew out the evening before the funeral, and left the evening afterwards. I slept in a hotel that night but woke early and got back by 8am that day. Not wanting to leave my wife unattended, my SIL (who lives about an hour away from us) agreed to take 3 days off from her job and come to help out in the house. As soon as she arrived, she was amazing. She spent time with both of us asking our preferences when it comes to baby care (changing, playtime, nutrition, etc). She then pulled me aside to ask things like where we kept our various cleaning supplies, if my wife has any strong preferences/aversions to cleaning practices, what food we had on hand and what she could go and pick up, etc. I was amazed at her generosity, especially in the haze of a newborn and grief. The funeral happened and I made it back as planned, but SIL had the rest of the day off and chose to spend it helping out further, allowing my wife to rest and me to wallow a bit. All said and done, I couldn’t be more grateful to my SIL. I obviously expressed it in words, but wanted to get her a gift to express my gratitude further. SIL LOVES the Tiffany brand, so I found a bracelet I knew she didn’t have and might like, and asked my wife what she thought. To be clear, I would have paid for this myself, and we’re lucky enough to be able to afford this comfortably. I also buy my wife jewellery fairly regularly - mostly from smaller brands, as that is her explicit preference. She has said multiple times how she doesn’t want ‘big name’ jewellery, even if money was no object. We’ve explicitly mentioned Tiffany in these discussions. My fiancée wasn’t happy, to say the least. She pointed out that I’d never bought her Tiffany jewellery (though as above, we’ve discussed how she’d never want any), and that it was a lot of money for ‘a bit of household help’.I made my point that SIL’s help let me go to an important funeral I otherwise would have missed, provided great assistance for a few days, and that we were lucky enough to easily afford this treat as a token of gratitude. I asked both sides candidly if there were any issues whilst I was away, but neither said that there were. I’m at a loss; I obviously won’t upset my wife, but feel strongly that I’d like to treat SIL for her help. WIBTA if I got her the bracelet?

10v8gqv,90,"My fiancé and I were living close to both of our parents, and moved out of state and now live very close to my fiancés’ sister and maid of honor (“SIL”).  She hasn’t been involved with wedding planning at all, even though she is familiar with the area (my parents live out of state).  My parents booked the venue last year, and are covering the cost of the venue.  A few days ago, I went out to lunch with the SIL and was asking her opinion on center pieces. Her initial opinion was that the centerpiece were overpriced and she wanted to ask her aunt for advice because her aunt just planned 2 weddings in the same area.  The SIL freaked out when I told her the price per person, and said the venue was garbage and my fiancé and I are stupid.  I reminded her that I’ve been trying to involve her, and her opinion would have been useful while we were booking the venue. I reassured her (1) the price was reasonable based on my experience looking at 10+ different venues; and (2) MY parents are paying for it.  I then told her to also ask her aunt about price per head because her aunt has similar amount of people.  She responded by saying “why would I ask my aunt? You don’t even have a house; when my cousins (aunts children)have a house”.  I told her she can’t use that as a baseline because her aunt bought the house for her children (cousins), and we just moved to this new state and are beginning our careers whereas her cousins are well established for many years here and technically don’t own the house because the Aunt owns the house that they live in. The SIL proceeded to call me stupid, materialistic and pretentious for “trying too hard” to be on the same caliber as her cousins and throwing a wedding I can’t afford clearly because I can’t even afford a house. (Technically I can afford a house but am choosing to rent because the housing market is not good and I’d rather wait 1-2 yeas for the market to cool down).I have a close relationship with my mom, who has been putting in so much effort and even flying to my new state to help plan the wedding. I am considering telling my mom because I feel bad that MY parents are paying for his family and guests, and are the only ones putting in any effort helping me plan the wedding. I know my mom will be extremely upset, and I don’t want to “shoot myself in the foot”. I think my SIL has been extremely disrespectful and my fiancés family have not been involved at all - I’d rather just not have a wedding if my fiancés family is going to treat me like this. Some backstory:  the SIL is 32 and single and known to have a big mouth and be rude sometimes. AITA if I tell my mom everything my future SIL has been saying; and consider cancelling the wedding or asking for his family to cover his guests?  This could damage the relationship between my mom and my fiancés family.

10v82lq,33,"I(f18) have been in a bit of an argument with my brother(16). I have a mediocre relationship with my brother, we don't hate each other and get along quite well, but it does get a bit strained at times. He spends most of his time in his room playing video games and doesn't really help me or my mother around the house often unless asked specifically.This has never been an issue in the past, but about 2 weeks ago I noticed a turd floating in the toilet. We have two toilets, but the other is at the other end of the house and I only really use it when I'm on my period, since my brother says ""He doesn't want my period on the toilet seat"". I flushed it down, not thinking much of it. 3 days later the same thing happened again, a turd floating in the toilet. This time I just politely asked him to flush the toilet properly next time. He told me it mustn't have flushed properly, so I took his word and left the situation alone.4 days later it happened again, this time the water was brown and disgusting, I went to tell him to please flush the toilet properly, a bit more sternly this time. He gave the same excuse again, I insisted and left the situation alone. The next day it happened again, I decided to ask my mother to talk to him about flushing the toilet properly, to which she said that he mustn't have wanted to cause too much noise since it was night.I told her I understood, but I am a heavy sleeper and I also just don't want to have to flush other people's shits down the toilet. She said she would talk to him, but never did.It happened 3 days in a row. I figured enough was enough. I decided to leave a sticky note on the door saying 'Please flush the toilet'. It was almost immediately taken down and obviously flushed down the toilet but my brother. I put one up again to sell the message that I will do it if he keeps on leaving his shit floating in the toilet. He came into my room and yelled at me for leaving sticky notes, to which I said that there wasn't much else I could do. He wasn't listening to me at all and my mother wasn't doing anything. He accused me of treating him like a baby, to which I said that I will continue to treat him like one if he doesn't flush the toilet.My mother told me that I was being condescending and rude to my brother, that I didn't understand. I get that sometimes toilets don't flush properly, but 3 days in a row was ridiculous and I was getting fed up with getting treated by his turds in the toilet and having to flush them down, especially when the water was brown.

My cousin on the other hand was born in Canada and has lived in the same nice suburban neighbourhood ( her dad/ my uncle is middle eastern but her mom is very European)  I have noticed that my cousin bases her whole personality on being Middle Eastern even though she doesn’t know how to speak and write Arabic. She also doesn’t really understand much of the culture. An incident happened yesterday, my cousin started putting Arabic in her insta bio. I got a bit pissed off because she doesn’t understand Arabic and the Arabic saying she had on her bio was pretty incorrect ( you can tell she just put it through Google translate) I confronted her about all of this. She said she is just as middle eastern as me. I disagreed and told her that she has never visited, lived, or grew up in the Middle East. She doesn’t know what it’s like being afraid for your life. And that she doesn’t understand witnessing her family members recover from the trauma of war. I also told her that when I came back to Canada from the Middle East, I was literally bullied so much for being middle eastern. I was called a terrorist. I was made fun of for my accent. I told her while she is half middle eastern, she shouldn’t base her whole personality on being middle eastern. I told her that I am the one being held at borders and getting profiled by border agents for being middle eastern.

And I apparently was the asshole for not feeding into the people pleasing, enabling behavior So two weeks ago. My parents who live a couple states away flew in to spend the weekend with us. My wife and I have 3 kids. All involved in sports, so it was a busy weekend with my parents getting to be a part of our life, and a part of their grandkids lives. All was going mostly well. My parents spend a lot of times glued to their phones (my oldest said something and my dad was offended).. my parents pushed off some  one on one time with my youngest.. and when the youngest shrugged it off and said whatever my parents were offended that he didn’t seem to care. So, like I said… the weekend was going mostly well. Every morning I had a quick easy grab and go meal, because we had to be out of the house early for sports for one of the three kids. The last morning, was a Monday and a day off school. we were all in the house, with nothing going but we only had 1 pack of bacon and 2 eggs left. It was a busy week, and weekend. And my wife and i hadn’t had a chance to get groceries before my parents arrived. So, with less food than normal.. I made the bacon and I made some pancakes. And I found some Canadian bacon to supplement it all. I chose not to make eggs. Because I couldn’t make enough for all 7 of us. My dad tries to grab 3-4 slices of bacon, I ask him to wait and let me serve him, so I can make sure everyone gets some. He huffs.. and takes his pancakes and won’t sit to eat. Stands at the table.

10vab0t,30,"Three years ago I moved into my current flat and almost since the very beginning I became close friends with my neighbour from the same floor. Mostly because we're the same nationality and it turned out we had some friends in common. Over the years we both helped each other out once in a while whether it was borrowing money, helping with some small repairs, grocery shopping etc. She's a single parent and I always felt kind of bad for her because she works two jobs and it sort of reminded me of my childhood so whenever she needed something I tried to help. When she started working her second job about a year ago she asked me if I could pick her daughter up from school and let her stay at mine till she came home at 8/9pm. Obviously I didn't have an issue with that since I finished work at 2.30 and her school was almost on my way home (she finishes school at 3pm). Her kid is also old enough that I didn't really have to do anything other than heat up some food and she just spends the entire time either playing on my PC or watching TV with me and sometimes my girlfriend. On Friday my neighbour asked me if her daughter could stay overnight at mine because she got asked to do a night shift instead of her usual evening shift to cover for someone. I didn't have any plans for Friday night anyway so I agreed. I told her daughter she could sleep on the sofa because I honestly didn't really feel like giving up my bed. The next morning when she came to pick her daughter up we talked for a few minutes and during the conversation I mentioned that her daughter slept on the sofa and she got mad at me and said I shouldn't have made her sleep there and that I was selfish for not letting her get a proper night sleep.

My dad had given me an investor relations type of role at his company so we were traveling a lot and then after that our kids needed our attentions. After our twins were born my wife was bedridden for longer than we and even the doctors expected. Since we had to hire extra hands to do the childcare tasks that involved mobility my wife had some time on her hands.Her mother told her that her friend who proctors at a testing center said that they give GED tests basically every week ( at least across the state of Idaho) and that she should dust off her general education knowledge. She started browsing her laptop and decided to enroll in a GED prep class online.It seems she was better at self paced learning than classroom learning because the stuff they were testing her on came way easier to her now than it did then even though she's been away from structured classroom instruction for many years now.Even after she was back on her feet, she'd be studying for it after she dropped the older two off to their respective schools. I would see what she was studying and it looked pretty rudimentary and I knew that getting a GED basically means nothing and that she probably wouldn't be able to apply it to anything career wise, or commit full time to community college, where I doubt the job prospects for students are that great right now either.So my wife ended up taking the test and the other day she bounded into the room and said "" Yes! I passed, I passed!""I knew she would since she was doing well on the practice tests and the GED consistently tests on the same rudimentary topics.

She said I didn't seem that excited and I said that it's great that she passed but I have been telling her that it was easy and no big deal, but if she needed something to prove to herself she knew the high school concepts, I guess the money was well spent.She got even more upset and said she worked very hard and this was the essential building blocks to being able to start a career.AITA?

My wife thought this would be great in the future to our parents live with us. This opened up a whole discussion.She immediately ruled out my parents as they are very well off and would never have the need to live with us from a financial prospective. We also spent about 4 weeks with them during COVID and realized we just weren't compatible . I 100% agreed with this sentiment.Then she brought up her dad  and step mom. Out of all our parental pairs we get along with her dad and step mom the best. They are good people who do not interject, judge or overstep into our lives. They are helpful when we ask for help (which we rarely do). She mentioned that they could live in the apartment as they are low maintenance and would keep to themselves. I agreed that they would be least intrusive on our lives but would prefer that they not live with us but I didn't shut the door on them.Then came the topic of her mother Sarah. My wife thought her mom living with us could be possible as she isn't married, she wants to spend more time with her grandson (and future grandchildren) and isn't as financially well off as the others. Sarah is a wonderful person who means well but has this frantic nervous energy about her that just wears on me. Her frantic nervous energy stems from severe anxiety that manifests itself by her wanting to please everyone. This might sound wonderful at first but it wears on everyone. Simple examples like her offering a glass of water turns into a game of 20 questions with her offering every beverage in the house to you after you state you are not thirsty. She has been in therapy for years for her anexity. This behaviour was a contributing factor in her divorce from Steve (to give some scale to how excessive it is). My wife also gets very frustrated with her mom but she manifests her annoyance by mirroring this type of behaviour. She will start speaking a mile a min asking me question after question before I have time to respond to the first.All of this lead to say that there is NO WAY Sarah could ever live with us.

Having her move in with us now or down the road would just be something I will not consider (barring a serious health issue or something of that nature).

We went to a party with her partner and lots of his friends, including his best friend. These guys are in their mid 30s and we're in our late 20s for context.So basically, the best friend of my friend's partner  is known in their group to have a drug problem and has erratic behaviour. During this party he had consumed drugs, I was just having some beers. At some point in the night we get talking (normal conversation, I was not flirtatious in any way because I honestly felt repulsed by the guy as he clearly finds himself very attractive and thinks everyone loves him). He out of the blue starts talking about image, and how everyone crafts their image based on what response they want from others, whereas I was disagreeing and saying while some people may do that others can just use their image as self expression/wearing what makes them feel good. He proceeds to say 'you for example, you clearly wore that dress tonight because you're looking for male attention, my eyes would obviously be drawn to your cleavage and you knew what you were doing when you wore that'. For context, I was wearing a long sundress that I had just bought that day with my friend,  not the most revealing thing, but sure it had a scooping neckline. I proceeded to tell him off and walked away. My friend had overhead some of it but I told her and her partner the whole story the next day.I was kind of expecting them to have some kind of a response, since I was a visitor and their friend made me feel so disrespected. But nothing really happened. The guy sends me a voice message a week later where he said : 'Im sorry YOU got triggered '.I decided to let the whole thing go but it definitely made me distance myself from my friend. Now this year I will be seeing her at a wedding and bachelorette party and called her about how it made me feel that she never stuck up for me. I didn't want my resentment about it coming out when we meet in person so I thought a call would be good to clear the air.She explained it away by saying they were just so tired of the guy and his antics at the time that they didn't have the energy to deal with it. I said that was not a good excuse and that I hope she'll learn to stand up for people she cares about rather than being an onlooker. She still regularly hangs out with the guy too. It pisses me off and her excuse made it worse.AITA?Edit: I really appreciate all the comments calling me the asshole because I needed another perspective.

To summarize our conversation, I apologized for embarrassing him and told him that I should’ve done it in private and he said he forgave me.

The first year residents are the ones who manage the postpartum, post surgery, evolutions and discharged paperwork we only help them with the easy parts once they are done, and some don't like being help with the last two. Also I had just been moved to that chiftSo I did a ""guardia"" so I had to work overnight and since it was the weekend it was until the start of the next chift and once we finish all the work.It had been around 17 hours and none of us had slept a thing, so we (interns) finished all the available paperwork for us to work with, but we still have some left we were waiting for to be finished so we could do our part. The other two interns with me decided to sleep a bit, after I asked one of them if there was anything else pending and he said no, that it was just waiting for that, so I decided to go help the interns schedule for that day since I wasn't sleepy at that point. Once the paperwork was available for us I started to that and the other interns went to work on something else. I also did some other work and I told a 2nd year resident about it since that was part of their paperwork (The more years and ranking you have, the more power you get) a 3rd year resident also told me it was fine and I could go home, afterwards another 2nd year resident told me I could leave. I've never liked leaving work undone for other people to do so I asked one of the three 1st year residents that are in charged of that and he told me since we were done with the paperwork I could leave so I did.After I got home I took a shower and I grab my phone to see many angry text for one of my co- interns looking for me and asking me how could I leave since they were still stuck with work to do (about an hour since I have left), so I replied and explained all that happened. And both of them replied that I shouldn't have left since I didn't tell them and that the other resident in charged of us still had worked to do and was asking us to help her (I did not asked her since she was in another floor at the time, I didn't know where, some people don't like help with that part, I didn't had her phone number and had already asked one of the other 3 people directly in charged of us), they said that was not how things worked out in that chift that they were finishing all the work and were also tired and wanted to go home but that they knew better and that they had to have that done first, that next time I should also clear it with them before I go (they were also told we could go home before I was and told me that, so I assume they were also going home once the finished their part).

10v8sxs,28,"Some context I (24M) own part of a Watersports business and recently got a job offer that I’m seriously considering taking. I’d call if more of a mom and pop business. This year I’d probably take in around 80k-100k which is great money but the only problem is I work 7 days a week, no holidays off and the only day I really get off are when the weather is horrible which is rarely all day. I recently just had a baby and have had a switch in perspective and now would like to be able to spend more time at home and not have my life revolve around my business. The offer I got is working under and contractor who in the next 3-4 years will teach me the business and help me get my general contracting license so I can start my own business. I’d be taking a pay cut making only about 45k-50k a year but I’d get weekends and holidays off which are important to me because of the baby. I also think even tho I’ll be taking a pay cut the next few years the opportunity I’ll have in the next 5-10 years with a GC license will be better off for my family and I than the business I have now. My partner is my business now is about 50M and relies on me pretty heavily, but to the point that I’m burnt out. I’ve worked for him for about 8 years and he’s been slowly bringing me in on the ownership side. A little too slow in my opinion, instead of making me a 50% partner from the start he’s been cutting me in on little parts of the business instead of just making me a 50% partner and it feels like he’s giving me just enough to keep me around instead of giving me my share. I understand it’s his business but he relies on my pretty heavily to the point where like I said I work every single day 8-9 hours a day and deal with every aspect of the business and instead of hiring new employees to take the load off he expects it out of me and wants to save money instead of hiring people so I can have off days and take time off. We also have different visions on the company’s future. I’d like the expand and take a more modern approach to the business which he likes doing everything pen and paper and is complacent where he’s at.

10v9fs8,16,"We met M (the friend) as we moved cities. My mother used to be very close with M's mother when they were younger, so the reunion was heart warming. We got close to the family and would often visit each other, until M's mother passed away due to cancer. That's when my mom started calling M every single day to check up on her, she'd say ""she doesn't have a mom anymore, she needs someone to rely on"". M was also pregnant with her second child at the time, so I understood why my mom took so much care of her. Now that was 3 years ago.For the past 3 years, while still videocalling her every day, my mom gradually started to worship M and her family, bringing them up in every conversation she has with me, or with people who don't even know them.   And when I say she ""worships"" them, she really does, for my mom, M is the prettiest and most intelligent person ever, she's also a great parent to her kids as she (wait for it) takes care of them (even though she's a housewife and has, really, nothing else to do), and don't get her started and how breathakingly beautiful and smart the kids are and on how amazing people they will become.  Imagine talking to your friend and she brigns up this family and how amazing they are every single time?? My mom had been looking for a job for a very long time and, what made me extremely upset, was that after signing the contract, she sent pics of it to M first, and I had to wait for several hours for her to get home and finally show it to me. And she does that for every single thing. Whatever new thing she buys, whatever she has on her chest, whatever happens to her, whatever she cooks, how many times she craps a day, M is always the first person to know about it and it annoys the hell out of me.I am aware that this is jealousy, as my mom never talks about me the way she talks about M or her children to other people, as she does to M's kids what she never did for me then, or now. They often come first. There's a cake me and M both like, but it isn't a cheap one. She rearely ever buys it for me, but she buys it for M when she visits her saying ""you'll it some there"" and dragging me along.M has done nothing wrong, what upsets me is that my mom worships them as if they were some gods and closes her eyes on every aspect of them that makes them who they are, a normal family, with average looking, average minded kids.

However I do pay bills, buy food on the occasion, clean the house every day, do bigger house projects with my brother (like build a new deck during the summer) and watch the kids whenever they need me to. Due to past experiences in the military that I won't get into here I don't leave the house often so I'm basically a built in nanny. I babysit the kids so often that when the kids were younger they often accidentally called me dad and a lot of their friends/bus drivers do think I am their dad as I drop them off at/pick up them up at the bus. They recently had another baby which means they expect me to babysit it all day while they go out and work. My best friend of nearly 15 years offered to let me move into his new house with him once they get settled in. After some initial hesitation I decided to move in with him as I don't really want to babysit their baby everyday for the next 4 years of my life.

Over the course of our relationship, Renzo has called me a c\*nt and been present on the day of our anniversary -- my friends and I honestly think he might be in love with Mike. This weekend was Renzo's birthday, and we all went out to celebrate. On Sunday, I received news that my Facebook had been hacked and disabled (I am a social media manager), so I was rightfully freaking out about my job. Because of this, Mike and I decided to not go out and complete the weekend of festivities for Renzo's birthday (drinking and watching ""Star Wars""). Mike was also feeling tired (he has some health issues that may lead him to need to give up drinking altogether).Renzo flipped out about us not attending, blaming it on me, and then proceeding to find my Twitter going back to when I opened the account in Feb. 2010 and screenshot Tweets he thought were ""incriminating"" (including one from Jan. 2012 where I asked a friend to find me ""a hot lawyer"" -- Renzo and Mike are both lawyers). Renzo called me a gold-digger, which I saw and sent a message to our group chat calling him out on his behavior -- first and foremost, going through my Tweets that far and secondly for the gold-digger comment (it is important to note that I come from a very privileged background and I have more in emergency savings than Mike).Renzo called Mike telling him that I never liked Renzo and he never liked me, but if we were to continue to date, it would ruin their friendship. I reached out to Renzo this morning asking if he would like to grab coffee or tea to sort through this for Mike's sake (especially considering the impending health issues) and he told me he wanted nothing to do with me among other choice words.Mike is distraught about all of this, which I understand -- he has known Renzo since they were in middle school and they lived together for two years.

When I came home, I politely asked her next time to have the reflex to refill things when they run low, because she had really dampened my morning.

For example, last week I had to remind her to buy more dishsoap when she was going to the grocery store. She said ""so freaking what, I bought it last time"" and we kinda snapped at each other.

10v9jpt,5,"My best friend and I have lived together for a few years. Recently, she has gotten a boyfriend. We will call her “Laura” and him “Ben”.  For some background: They only have sex at our place. Why? Because Ben is cheating on his partner, “Sarah”, with Laura. Laura knows, but Sarah does not. I’m WEIRDLY not bothered by this (except for the fact that I think Laura may potentially get her heart broken). Ben is a great guy and I truly believe this is a one-off for him as far as cheating goes. They just randomly had eyes for each other almost immediately after meeting. Sarah has not treated Ben well and she has cheated on other partners in the past. Anyway, I can hear Laura and Ben going at it regularly. I can hear them if I sit on our balcony because her window is right there. I can hear them in the common areas of the apartment because we have vinyl throughout and it echoes. They keep the door closed, but it isn’t enough. I have to be out in the kitchen if it is in the morning to make coffee and breakfast. I really don’t want to eat my breakfast in my bedroom. Even then, I can hear them in there… with my door closed… if they are “finishing”. The only way I can totally escape the sound is to go in my bathroom and turn the fan on. It isn’t the slapping, or even Ben’s breathing that gets to me. It’s Laura’s moaning. She’s like a sister to me and it makes me VERY uncomfortable. In my past relationship, my ex-boyfriend and I were always super careful to keep the noise down if she was home. I would keep my “vocalizations” to more of a heavier breath and whisper. I consciously didn’t want her to hear me out of embarrassment for myself. Plus, I knew it would be uncomfortable for her. The past few times I’ve heard them, I lightly joked about it to her. She would laugh, cringe, and apologize. The other day, I had had enough. The following evening during dinner, I asked her to please try to keep it down because it makes me uncomfortable. I never once raised my voice, or got mean. I told her sternly, but kept it light and even laughed a little. She got VERY defensive and said “You know how it is in the moment! I don’t even think about it! Go in your bedroom or something!” I don’t believe this. I’ve told her multiple times that I can hear her. There’s no way she doesn’t think about it. I just don’t think she cares. Plus, why should I have to inconvenience myself just for her to have fun? It’s not my fault they can’t keep it down and he’s cheating. Now, she’s been a bit standoffish toward me off and on. She can hold grudges and I feel like she’s going to stay mad at me for a bit. I heard them again this morning and they were LOUDER THAN EVER. I could tell exactly when it was all over because I could hear both of them moaning insanely loud as they “came to fruition”. I feel bad because I want her to have fun.

We hadn’t really talked much about his family, I knew he had a sister around my age, but they haven’t been super close since he moved so he doesn’t mention her much. I didn’t know if there was a story there but he obviously didn’t talk about it so I didn’t particularly care, because I think it’s a little early to be sticking my nose in his business with his family.So anyway, this weekend I stopped over at his place after a particularly bad day at work. I didn’t call ahead because we’ve never had that kind of a relationship before and have never cared if the other drops by unannounced. Well come to find out his parents were visiting (he hadn’t told me) and they were there at his apartment. He invited me in and introduced me as his girlfriend who was just stopping by and not staying long, which I thought was weird, but I get not being ready to introduce me to your parents. Then he gets a call and steps out for a second, his dad asks me basic questions like my name, where I work, etc. So I introduce myself more properly and both his parents get a weird look on their face.

She didn't tell me what it was, but she did tell me not to tell my aunt as my aunt wanted it to be a complete surprise. I'm thinking, why imform me that there was going to be a surprise in the first place then? Over the week, my stepmother, slowly and ""discreetly,"" revealed what the surprise was going to be by asking me gift ideas. That was two days ago. Today, she completely revealed what the surprise gifts were going to be. And she made sure to tell me once more that I can't tell my aunt that I know, and that when I get the surprise, I should act shocked....WHY TELL ME?I'm not upset that I know what the surprise was going to be. I don't really care, in fact. I'm more upset that my stepmother went against my aunts wishes. My aunt wanted it to be a surprise, and my stepmother ruined that for her. My reaction will no longer be genuine, and I feel guilty for having to pretend that I'm surprised. I just hate that my aunt is going through the trouble of being discreet for nothing. I just wish I knew why people feel the need to ruin surprises for others...Anyway, I'm planning on telling everyone even though it will put my stepmother on the spot. I just don't think it's right, and I want my stepmother to know that. I hate to have to pretend to be surprised.

I am pretty inattentive when it comes to not losing things had often lamented that I had lost many of the mementos I had of my family member to my chagrin so this seemed like a nice way to more permanently keep her memory alive. When I first suggested I wanted to also get a similar tattoo, egg white seemed supportive. Fast forward a couple of months and I am actively looking for tattoo parlors to get this underway and am excited when it appears like I’ve found a good option. However, when I bring this up to egg white, they look visibly upset, so I ask, “are you mad?” And they say “I’m not mad” then pauses and says “but why would you steal my idea instead of coming up with your own” to which I respond, “ok so you clearly have feelings about this” and they say “I don’t have feelings, you can get a tattoo of whatever you want” in a passive aggressive tone. We kind of left it thereI understand where they are coming from because the idea was personal, but that’s why I liked it also, it was the most direct and simple  way to pay homage to my deceased family member I could think of.

Me ( M 24) and my Gf(F 23) moved in together recently and it's going great. I own a car and she currently doesn't and also has no intent of getting one at the moment. Before we moved in together, I used to take my car to work. But now that we moved in together, she takes it to drive to work, because her work is a daily drive of 150 km away (so 300 km a day back and forth, about 185 Miles daily). And I can drive to work by bicycle which only takes me about 15 minutes and it's pretty easy to get there because of bike lanes in Europe. She obviously agreed to pay for the Gas. The question is, would it be fair to also ask her for money for the ""wear"" on the car she produces? Until we move away or she has a different job, she will have put at least 30. 000 to 40. 000 KM of wear on the car. When I decide to sell the car, that will definitely decrease the value of my car by a not so insignificant amount. So would it be fair to ask her for a compensation of that potential cost? I just feel like it would be a super greedy thing to ask, and although this text may sound like it, I'm usually the opposite of a greedy person.

The relationship became verbally abusive and I decided to move out and leave, he kept calling me an idiot among other things that weren't going to work for me, although I suppose that's irrelevant. We dated about 1 year. During separation I initially agreed to cover 50% of his flight loss since the tickets were non-refundable(could only get the taxes back). Although, he could have used the full cost of the ticket to re-book anywhere else another time, he wanted the refund. He got a voucher code to rebook elsewhere anyway, but reached out to me after 2 weeks wanting to work on things and go to therapy. I thought it's best to try, he ended up re-booking the tickets. Things didn't end up working and now he's put in the refund for taxes to the airline and asked me to send him the full 50% loss. I had been thinking about this for a while and am now struggling to wrap my head around why I actually have to cover half the loss for him. I feel no way responsible to owe him anything for a risk he chose to take. Leaving and moving already cost me a great amount of money and concerns since I already moved back to this country for him. We split everything when I left, I didn't even factor in some of the home goods such as oil left in heating tank etc. He still has $425 (my half)of the rental deposit which I was supposed to get back at the end of the lease, whenever he moves out.

So, if you find anything in the story that (grammatically) makes no sense, I apologise in advance.**Story:**For context, I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/u7fm83/my_dad_demands_my_salary/) post in another subreddit a few months ago. To make the story short, my dad has always been abusive towards me. It slowly changed when I got a job and started demanding a part of my salary (thinking he deserved it since he raised me).A lot has happened since then. I got diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder. I was prescribed meds, some of which are highly narcotic. So, when I take them, I either get super sleepy or grumpy. So, to avoid problems, I would sleep for a few hours after taking the meds. This way, I can avoid interacting with others while I'm under (if I worded it right).Now, let's jump to the present. My birthday was a month ago. So, I felt like visiting my family and having a good time as I thought we could put our differences away and spend some time together as a ""family."" I thought that my family would've moved forward since my last visit. I didn't expect them to welcome me with open hands but that they would adjust their inner thought for just a few days.God, was I wrong! Firstly the whole house was a mess. I had to clean and cook something fresh (every food item was rotten). Most irritatingly, every single adult in the family avoided me. When I play with the kids - which I love doing - they would be given obnoxious jobs. At one point, I just went out to take some time for myself. I had to buy my own birthday cake and gift(s) - which isn't new at this point.After I tried to blend in with a few of them, one of my cousins (who's in high school right now) told me that my dad explicitly told everyone not to entertain me in any way. That enraged me.I crashed into the room where my dad was and called him useless. He got angry and yelled at me, saying stuff like, *""What haven't I done for you?"", ""You owe me everything that's yours!""* etc. (which made me laugh, not sad). After I didn't comply, he told me to get out of his house. I smirked and told him I would be moving out anyway (since I have my own place now), even if he didn't tell me that. I reminded him that He doesn't know how anything works. He doesn't even know where to throw away the garbage (it's 50m from the main door, FYI). Also, he's too slow even if he did know how everything works. He might've been good in his prime days 60-70 years ago, but now he can walk at a speed of 0.2 m/s.This time, I decided never to head back until they call me to come back themselves.

After coming back, he instantly brings up how he forgot the lint roller at home (he had already forgot to order it for 2 weeks, and he’s also mentioned a vacuum for a month but i guess thats forgotten too) He also did a load of Laundry the day he came back, which sat for a total of 16ish hours, and the dryer filter was again not cleaned after. In the 24 hours after he came back, he also somehow managed to stack 3 full cups of liquid on the kitchen counter, barely drank from.&amp;#x200B;He is improving, but at a snails pace: Bought a lint roller to clean? Forgot it at home; Thanked him for dish washing progress? Immediately forgets for a week; only took 16 hours to do laundry this time? Still too long, and still didnt clean the filter; Promised to clean after his cat?

Ive basically made up my mind to email the landlord about eviction. AITA for doing this? Yall can see he is making progress, but to me, his progress is not even getting him to the bare minimum, regardless of autism or not.

We're a couple in our 40s.Husband kept telling the young waiter how foxy and sexy he was and asking him for his phone number, and I nearly facepalmed.He then was asking the waiter if he'd come to meet him in our hotel room and said that it was worth it for him, and he didn't give a hoot about what else he had to do. He also gave the waiter OUR PHONE NUMBER and told him to come and meet us back in Bethesda and to bring us some of the cakes from the restaurant if he could get some.Later that day, I told my husband he was a jerk and embarrassed me in there. I said to him I wouldn't invite him to meet my friend if he kept up this behavior.We're also here to meet some fellow Americans living in London too, I've got two friends from Bethesda living here who I used to know from my days working in a pizza restaurant there.He's not normally like this and before now, hasn't shown any behaviors which make me think he's gay.But he was like a dog on heat, it was fucking weird.

10v9vrx,625,"Backstory, my fiancée and I have been together for about 4 years. She has two kids (12f, 15f) with shared custody. It’s an odd arrangement, she has them Jan-June. Early September, she moved into our house. My daughter ‘Charlie’ is 10. For the record, up until recently she has been an amazing mother figure to Charlie. Our first issue was back in November as we discussed bedroom arrangements. She felt her eldest should have a room of her own while living here 6 months out of the year. That would cause Charlie to bunk with her youngest. I however did not allow it because that would encroach Charlie and likely cause her to feel alienated in her own home. Last weekend I was called in and worked a 12hr shift. When I arrived home, Charlie was upset because they went out to eat and left her home. She said when they came back, she was handed a bag of takeout and the food was stone cold. I asked my fiancée to elaborate, to which she confirmed taking only her girls out to an early dinner then took them to play mini golf. Hence why the food was cold, it sat in the car as they played. She kept deflecting to the food, saying she didn’t expect her to eat it cold, she could have warned it up herself. I kept insisting it was extremely rude to exclude Charlie from the outing. She came back with…”But I brought her food home.” She then asked, “Why is it ok for you to go out with just Charlie?” That’s different, in the last 30 days her kids have been here, Charlie and I have only gone grocery shopping or on one occasion took her cat to the vet. That can’t even be compared to what she did.We didn’t come to any sort of an agreement. Friday she was taking her girls to the dentist. On the way out she made the snarky comment, “I hope this doesn’t offend Charlie too.” It pissed me off she said that, I called her feral. We both later apologized, but she then started the argument back up. She said it was so rude of me to argue about her taking her kids out. She further said, “I don’t see my kids for 6 months, excuse the hell out of me for wanting to spend time alone with them.” I understood her point, but I felt like we could periodically plan separate outings on the same day so no one feels excluded. She kinda threw the bedroom ordeal in my face and said, “My kids might feel alienated from their own mother if they can’t enjoy time alone with me.” She made the pointless remark that her kids have no problem with her doing things with Charlie while they’re living with their father. She further argued that there will be many times when Charlie will be excluded because of the age gap between her and the eldest. I told her if she expects things to workout, she would need to treat Charlie as one of her daughters. She said I was entirely missing her point because I don’t know what it’s like having shared custody.

10vccne,225,"Three years ago my wife and kids wore me down and I agreed to let them get a dog.  I am not a dog person.  They seem like very fine people but they are just not for me.   The deal was that I wouldn't have to walk it or clean up after it and that they would take care of it.  It went fine for about a year and a half.   But once the damn thing was out of its puppy phase they lost most interest.  So for about two years now I have been walking it because it needs exercise.  I have to buy it food because my wife forgets.  I have to walk around the back yard before I mow to make sure I'm not going to run over it's turds.  I'm done.  I came home yesterday and it had chewed up a pair of my shoes.   I waited until dinner and then I laid down the law.   Thay poor thing is going stir crazy.   It is used to getting their attention and stuff all the time because of COVID.  Now that they can do other stuff they are ignoring it.  It isn't fair to the dog and it isn't fair to me.  I said that if they didn't have time to walk it they could play with it in the back yard.  But that if I found any turds back there that I was hiring a service to keep the yard clean but the money was coming out of their allowances or the house budget.  I said I wasn't buying any more food.  If there was no food and the dog wasn't fed I would be hiring someone to watch the dog and once again they would be paying for it.  They got upset with me because the dog likes me and it's obviously my dog.  Of course the thing likes me, I take care of it, which I don't want to do.  So I brought out our agreement which I made them all sign.  Not my responsibility.  I said they had three choices.  Take care of the dog, rehome the dog, or pay someone else to take care of the dog.  They all think I'm being too harsh but I don't think so. I didn't want it on the first place. I've already checked with a friend of mine. She likes dogs and has agreed to take it if my family cannot follow through.  My wife says that I'm being an asshole with this ultimatum.  I think it's fair.

10vc179,55,"   I (37f) have 6 kids (15f, 13m, 11m, 9f and 6f, 2m) with my husband (37m). Recently, one of my sisters (31f) asked to temporarily move in with us because of repairs being done to her home, which is not up to code. She has a husband (31m) and a son (10m). My nephew is not a good kid, he’s a bully and frequently misbehaves. However, I decided to let her family stay anyways.Our 13 y/o is autistic, he’s a very bright boy and actually quite popular, but he still struggles with sensory issues, social interactions, ect. As I mentioned, he’s still popular and social, mainly because he’s an athlete. Our son plays baseball and lacrosse and is friends with the popular group of athlete boys in his school. These boys do everything together, they hang out pretty much every day until bedtime, they help each other with homework, play video games, ect. It’s really sweet how close they are. The boys helped manage my son’s successful run for school president and are always each other’s biggest supporters. Our son is closer to these boys then he is to family, our son doesn’t like hugs, except for these boys, he tells them secrets he doesn’t tell family. My nephew seems to have an issue with this, and has pushed my son’s boundaries since arriving.Yesterday, I was dropping of my son at one of his friend’s houses. The boy he is friends with collects all sorts of stuff, including fragile busts of athletes. My sister and her son decided to tag along with us while dropping him off. It turns out that my nephew is in the same class as this boy’s sister. Judging from the stories I’ve heard, my son’s friend’s sister is also a little terror. My son went with his friend, my nephew with his friend, while we sat in the car talking to the mom of the boy and girl. While we were sitting, the boys come rushing out to tell us that while they had left the room to go in kitchen, my nephew went in the boy’s room and was touching with stuff, he ended up breaking 2 busts. Thankfully, with the boys help, we found replacements online and bough them. The total cost came to around $500, which their parents could afford, but so could my sister. My sister said she didn’t want to pay for them because she didn’t want to make her son feel bad for making his mom have to pay for this. The other mom went in the house, while we argued in the car. I told her that if she didn’t pay back, she’d have to find someone else to stay with, so she ended up forking over the money. She told her son about it and he said we were being unfair and this wouldn’t have happened if my son and his friends just “did what I say”. My sister is still upset at me and some of our siblings have chimed in to take her side, saying I was being too punitive on her son.

When my dad taught me how to handle my period we lived in a different country and he gave me a reusable pad, which is just some cloth and told me to wash them when they got dirty. He never got me pads or tampons and said that this was better.Some years back we moved to the UK and here my school has pads and tampons in the loo. Recently I decided to start taking some of them and taking extra to take home. I do not mind the reusable one my dad gave me but I find them less convenient as I have to wash them and they do not fit as well which has led to a few embarrassing incidents at school. Luckily though none of my classmates were ever mean about it.My dad recently found the used tampons in the bin and he got angry with me then found the extra tampons and pads I stole from school in my room. He forbade me from taking them again and threw them out. I got upset since I am the one who does most of the chores like emptying the bins so he should not have seen it.I do not understand, my teachers specifically said we could take extra if we needed so I do not think it is stealing. In my other country I know girls use both cloth and pads and tampons but here in the UK everyone uses the disposable products. My dad also makes me eat after my brother and him when I am on my period even when I do the cooking and it bothers me as the other girls at school do not have to do this. He says this is respect for our culture and nothing about germs.Edit: I cannot do anything that will get my dad or family in trouble. We are not citizens here and I do not want issues for our visas. I want to leave home when I go to university and I am waiting for us to get indefinite leave to remain status.

10vbtrv,99,"Good morning, all. TL;DR at the bottom.I (22F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for almost three years now. In that three year period, he has met basically my entire family. I have a very big, very close-knit family. On the flip-side, his family is a lot smaller and a lot less close-knit. He has an estranged sister who his mom forbids him from having a relationship with, a couple of aunts that he hasn’t seen in awhile, and a grandfather who is really getting up there in age that he hasn’t seen since he was a kid. I have only met his parents. My boyfriend had a dream that his grandfather died, and it spooked him, so he reached out to his grandfather that same day. He found out that his grandfather is not doing great health wise, so he decided he should go and visit him. He picked a time to go and has the trip all planned. When he first started planning the trip, I said I would love to help him plan it and go with him. I thought maybe he could use some support. I mean, he’s going to see his dying grandfather, who he hasn’t seen in years. It seems like it might be sort of emotionally tolling. He was VERY against the idea of me going, and it seemed to upset him that I had even suggested it. He said he just wants to have his own time with his grandfather. I completely understood this and backed off right away. Now, here’s where I think I might be the asshole. I found out recently that he’s taking a friend with him on this trip. Apparently there are a lot of rock-climbing opportunities in the state where his grandfather lives, and they’re going to take advantage of that on this trip. I will admit, this rubbed me the wrong way and I was upset. I brought the subject up again because I was pretty annoyed, and he got mad and told me, and I quote, “To plan my own trips and stop trying to hitchhike on mine.” Like, what? Then he said I could invite him on a trip I plan, but I’m not going on this one with him and to get over it. I was mad. I was upset. I felt angry and dismissed. So, I booked an all-inclusive trip to Mexico for about 2 months after his trip to “see his grandfather”, and I didn’t invite him. I’m going to go and spend time being warm and getting tipsy on a beach. He thinks it was petty of me to do that, and not ask if he wants to come, too. He claims I’m the one being dismissive of the fact that he just wants to visit his grandfather without me there. He says that this trip is way different than the one he’s going on. I told him to plan his own trips and stop trying to hitchhike on mine. He wasn’t impressed.AITA for planning this trip and not asking if he wants to come?

He owes over 10k in taxes, has 2 broke down vehicles, and has on and off jobs. He smokes weed constantly and can barely afford food for him, his wife, and their dog.

Into teenagerhood and adulthood, her attitude has started to affect me and our family more. Her mom never really said “no” to her much growing up and she got away with a lot because she had a rough childhood in general and they never had money. This didn’t affect me until we got older and she started making everything about her. For example, one year at our GIANT family Christmas she was going around pulling people aside telling them she had Post-Partum Depression after her first child. I sympathized with her, but it was so inappropriate for the setting. She also didn’t really need to be telling our extended family and taking up time they could have spent catching up with others they hadn’t seen all year. Her behavior is so bad, many family members have cut her out of their own lives for the purpose of mitigating drama. She never gets invited to weddings.

I do feel terrible that she has to miss out on senior activities. I also feel a little guilty about it, but she isn’t my child and I shouldn’t be forced to pay just because her own mother won’t.

10vc93n,33,"Quick reference points: I am a male (28) and I live with my girlfriend (27). We have lived here for almost a year. This particular situation has gone on since we moved in.The apartment that I live in shares a wall with the apartment to my left, the only shared wall we have with this particular apartment. Unfortunately, that shared wall is actually the divider between the two bedrooms. Inherently, this really isn't a huge issue. I've had shared walls like this before, and the nature of noise within shared living complexes is something that I am familar with and have a tolerance for given the circumstances.All of this being said, I have a reached a breaking point with the volume at which my neighbor yells when he is climaxing. It feels almost comical to type this out, because I almost feel like \*I\* am the one at fault here for caring so much, and it is truly difficult to emphasize the loudness through text.At least 3-5 times a week, at all kinds of random times of day, my neighbor climaxes so loudly that I can hear it clear as day in my apartment. It is usually a combination of intense moaning with \*many\* ""oh fuck, fuck, fuck"" or some sort of variation of swear words. I almost wouldn't even care if the intensity and frequency were somewhat balanced. But this shit happens often, and never goes unheard. At first it was kind of funny. My girlfriend and I laughed it off and were just excited to be moved in and living together. But we've reached a point where it's just starting to be flat out invasive. I reached my breaking point when I was on a Microsoft Teams meeting (I work from home) and as I was updating my team on my work for the week, this dude maxxed the fuck out. It was so loud and vulgar that i just left the meeting and came back on chalking it up to ""my internet going out"". Given the sexual and personal nature of what's happening, after finally having enough I wrote a note explaining that this guy needs to get a grip when he climaxes, and that it is invasively loud, too frequent, and is entirely devoid of consideration for the people around him. I did mention the business meeting scenario as well. I left the note in the windshield of this guy's car.I did not sign the letter because my girlfriend isn't particularly keen on me drawing attention to ourselves, but I just couldn't let this shit keep going unchecked.AITA here because I just need to not dictate someone's sex life, or do I have grounds here for trying to not feel violated in my own home??",AITA for telling my apartment neighbor to get a grip on how loudly he's climaxing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vc93n/aita_for_telling_my_apartment_neighbor_to_get_a/
10vcjjl,51,"Somebody in our extended family recently came out as gay. I was worried for them, because I know some of the attitudes that some members of our extended family hold on this. The worst reaction came from one of my aunts, who even went as far as to refer to him with terms like ""groomer"", and said that she does not want him near her children anymore, because she both does not want them to be groomed, and does not want her children ""exposed to that crap"".In response to this, I have said that I will no longer be attending any events where my aunt will be present, both in disgust as to her behavior and in support of this person in my family who came out as gay.

10vc5lb,23,"Hello, I’ve done something bold and something I think is a long time coming.I (34m) for many years defended and loved my father because it is who he is. I try to typically see the hood in people. We however, have had quite the rocky relationship.The spark notes version is when I was younger, he left and married into a different family but was nice a lot of the time, I spent weekends with him and my step family. As I got older he got less present and honestly I’m jealous he put a lot of effort into my younger half brother (who is now 19). He’s also said some very rude and disrespectful things to me as I’d gotten older, once asking if I could lend him money to go see his mother as she was in hospice. I didn’t have any money, I was overdrawn in my account (I was 20) at the time so I unfortunately couldn’t assist him. When she passed he got mad at me and said it was fucked up and couldn’t help him when he thinks I would have done so for my moms family (I was raised pretty much exclusively by my mom.) There are several other things I could remark on, but that’s for my therapist. The long story short is he’s never been as present or prevalent as he believes he has.Over the years, we had an on again off again good relationship, and he’s gotten ill with something called spinocerebellar ataxia. It impairs his movement and his ability to speak, he is in a motorized wheelchair now and has a hard time talking. In addition it is painful to listen to him as mentally I always remember him being in this great shape and now he’s almost unable to be understood and is declining.I texted him on his birthday wishing him a happy birthday, I didn’t call because I know it’s painful to talk. My birthday is three days later, and he sends me a scathing text message that he goes off on me and says that I should mean more to him than a text. I had told him my side and told him we should talk about our history some.Months pass, nothing comes from it. My grandmother on his sides birthday just passed and he was upset that I didn’t wish her a happy heavenly birthday. He texted me and said that it was fucked up that I don’t seem to care as much about his family as I do my moms (it shouldn’t matter but I’m biracial and he did point out that he thinks I care more about my white side than my black side.)I had enough and I didn’t think it was his place to send me such a message especially coming after my other family. So I told him I am done speaking with him until he evaluated himself as a father and comes up with a meaningful apology. Am I the asshole?Edit 1 (since things are coming up here a lot)- He communicates with most people if not all specifically via text. It hurts him to talk and his speech is almost unrecognizably slurred.- The grandmother I couldn’t give him the money to see has passed 15 years ago.

10vfhpb,48,"I (35F) have been with my partner (36M) since just before the lockdowns. We were one of those couples whose relationship got greatly sped up because of the pandemic. This has been compounded by the fact that we live in a one room home and cannot get away from each other very effectively..He is a very nice person and I love him, but we have spent a lot of time disagreeing, to the point where I have wondered if we are really compatible long term. Our most common arguments up to this point are about s3x (I'm a 1x a day girl, he's a 1x a year guy) and about interacting (I love in depth conversations and debates, he prefers peace and quiet/ parallel play). I am giving this as background because I want to make sure I am not being biased in any way..Recently, he told me he was going to buy property for him and his family. I was supportive, because that is a great investment for them. When he went to buy the property, my partner whipped out a check for $60,000. I had assumed he was going to put a downpayment on something, but no— he was buying it outright with a check for $60,000 that he could just... write. And pay. Without it bouncing..I was stunned. I have been buying groceries for the both of us 95% of the time since 2020. I knew he earned a bit more than I do (he works for himself, I do social work), but the EXTENT of it... I have been draining my savings account over and over for YEARS and often having to ask my parents for help just to feed us and put gas in the car (also my expense 95% of the time). I figured that groceries were how I contributed to the household, and that he too was more or less treading financial water trying to keep us afloat. As he has pointed out, he gets things like firewood and some systems for the house that help it function(things like ikea bookshelves). He always has had money to get himself expensive electronics (drones, etc)..My partner has no idea why I am upset about this. Every time we have discussed it, he has seemed genuinely shocked at my reaction, and no amount of my attempting to reframe it has gotten him to understand my perspective. He points out that when we get take out food (usually 1x a month) he covers it, and he covers laundry expenses (a recent development, &lt;1 year), and he says the expensive electronics he buys he uses for his business (that much is true). He thinks I am overreacting and that I am intentionally ruining what should be a happy moment for him..I have gone to see family for couple days to clear my head. My sisters have called my partner predatory and say he's taking financial advantage of me. I feel like I am going crazy and I am doubting myself every minute... Please, internet, AITA for feeling taken advantage of here?.**TL,DR:** Partner managed to save $60,000 while I have been financially struggling due to buying groceries for both of us for years.

10vcyik,30,"My husband and I have been married over 8 years.  When we were dating we did some partying that included festivals, clubs, raves, drinking and drugs.  It's not normally something I'm into but hey, every once in a while, why not let loose?  I was in a new town and dating a new fun guy.  A few months into dating I made clear that the partying was not a lifestyle for me and that if we were to continue dating, drugs could not be a part of our life.  Now we are nearing our 40's and he still goes out occasionally to clubs and festivals to drink and do drugs.  Maybe a few times a year.   He is open and honest about the alcohol and drug use.  He says that music is his passion and he really loves the DJ's and that sometimes he gets fomo when he sees all the people partying on social media.  He did get to party a lot in his 20's, which I feel like can be an important part of growing up and having fun and making memories and experiences that will last a life time. Most of the time he goes by himself as I will not longer go to these things and he doesn't have any friends who like that sort of thing either.  His excessive drinking and dishonesty with drug use in the past had nearly drove us to divorce.  I only came back when he went through AA and got his drinking under control.  He has gotten a DUI in the past before I met him, and until I put my foot down he still was driving with a bac higher than legally allowed when we met.  The drugs are definitely not legal.  All the common club drugs that are popular these days.  I toleratehis occasional partying even though I don't agree with it because he supports my cycling and outdoor hobbies.  Twice I've taken a week to do a cycling tour with a friend (a guy friend if it matters).  He supports me if I want to take outdoor classes or go backpacking with friends even if he doesn't care to go.   Am I being unreasonable and possessive if I don't want him to go?  If music and festivals are really his passion the way the outdoors is for me... how could I say no to that?  I don't really ever want to be the one to tell someone ""no"", I'm not his mother or the police.  Otherwise we have a great relationship.  We love each other's company and spend most of our free time together.  We exercise together and try to live mostly healthy in the mean time.  We are not suspicious or jealous people.  ... But it still doesn't feel good, I don't like that he goes alone and don't like that he's intoxicated.  It would be completely different if he were sober.  I trust his judgement when he's sober, but intoxicated on alcohol and illegal drugs is a whole different thing.

From the very beginning we have planned for a kid-free wedding aside from my Fiancé’s son, my sister's baby, and my future sister-in-law’s/fiancé’s sister’s baby. The babies are only an exception because the mothers both nurse.  All other children including all the other nieces and nephews aren’t allowed (we already have invitations that say no kids). My fiancé has ten nieces/nephews and I have one. The place we are getting married at has a capacity of 100 (adding ten people to this will be an extra $1500 in fees/costs). His parents vetoed our first wedding venue choice and threatened to take money away because it was too far away. This was a big issue between us but eventually we ended up finding one that was 30 minutes away from us, that was a bit cheaper, but would only be able to accommodate 100 people.  His parents were happy. Throughout our planning process, we let everyone know our wedding is a more upscale black-tie event and that we wanted a kid free wedding.  His family kept brushing us off every time we’d mention the no kids thing. We finally put our foot down and said this isn’t a discussion/joke and they were obviously upset. We told them 1) we just don’t want kids there, 2) the kids aren’t well behaved and the parents don’t supervise them, 3) the kids won’t want to be there, and 4) we have other people who we would much prefer to have there. His parents told us “this will have to be discussed” and that this would be an issue for their family. They proceeded to tell us weddings are about family.  And I told them weddings are about the bride and groom and who they want to celebrate their day with. Two weeks later, my fiancé’s parents cornered him. They told him all his sisters were upset (even the ones without kids), they told him the 100 person count shouldn’t matter and they’ll just not invite their friends. His father promised to watch the kids the entire time and make sure they are on their best behavior at the wedding. And his parents told him two of his sisters didn’t feel like flying their families out for a wedding the kids couldn’t go to was worth it. My fiancé told them he’d discuss it with me. Fast forward another few days and my fiancé decides to call and hear directly from his sisters about it. All three said their kids were hurt they weren’t going to be allowed at his wedding. They told him that if behavior is a concern then my fiancé and I need to sit down and tell everyone our expectations. I don’t want kids at the wedding and the way his family has acted regarding this issue has reinforced my desire for a kid free wedding.

Over the course of our relationship, I also spent quite a considerable amount for her dad's hospital bills in the name of a loan to her, but obviously, I never got any of that money back.She texted me out of the blue to ask me to help out with her vet bills, and I helped her with about 15k in the span of a month.

10vczwk,23,"I (24 F) am getting married in October and graduating with my doctorate in May. Growing up, my biological father was never a part of my life. I always wondered what it would be like to have him in my life, and it affected me deeply emotionally growing up. I had met him a total of 3 times. Once when I was 3, when I was about 8, and then again when I was 12. All times he would go no-contact after our visit for a few years and then contact again after a few years. But after the last visit when I was 12, he never reached out again until I reached out to him. When I was a senior in high school, my mom finally found his number and gave it to me and told me to do whatever I wanted with it. I messaged him, and we actually kind of reconciled, but I never fully forgave him. Up until July of last year, our relationship was ok. But he came to visit me in July, and the entire time all he did was talk about how terrible my mother is and embarrass me everywhere we went. I didn't understand how someone could talk so poorly of my mother when she never kept him from me and always made sure I had everything I ever needed and wanted. Then at every restaurant he would make sexual remarks towards waitresses or when he did not get something quick enough he would throw a fit and scream at them/management. It made me extremely uncomfortable. He would even talk about him and my step moms sex life and talk poorly of her. (She wasn't there, he was just in my city working and she was back home, he lives in another state). After our visit, I decided to go no-contact with him. I haven't heard from him since July. He texted me on my birthday in October, like 11pm. I have decided to invite his sister however who I have never met. She went no-contact with him when they were kids, because of the way he behaved and stole from their mother. But, his sister has always been there for me (emotionally) since I was born, although never meeting her in person. She always answered phonecalls and text messages. We were supposed to meet up finally last summer, but due to the financial constraints of being in school, I wasn't able to afford the vacation she had planned. She seems so excited to be there and has already booked a hotel. She tells me how proud she is of me constantly and how she is so happy I didn't turn out like him. She always talks so beautifully of my mother, telling me how happy she is that I had her to raise me.However, my fiance and many others are telling me that I will regret not having my biological father there. But, I don't consider him my father. My grandfather (and grandmother) helped my mom raise me. And my grandfather taught me everything a dad should have, so he will be walking me down the aisle to give me away and the father-daughter dance. So, AITA?Edit: I forgot to add that this was not our first meeting since we reconciled my senior year. Before this, he had actually attended my high school graduation. Then when I was in college I went and was supposed to spend a week with him and my step mom in his state. However, I stayed 2 nights and then decided to leave because he was making me extremely uncomfortable. I also wanted to add that my step mother is an absolute angel and honestly if it was not for her he probably would have never even replied to me back when I texted him for the first time my senior year. I think that is what makes this so difficult because by cutting him off, I have to cut her off too, and she is absolutely not a part of my decision for cutting him off. I honestly wish she would leave him and find better, because she deserves it.Edit #2: My fiance's bio dad did basically the same thing to him. He recently passed away.

(I have masters from media and journalism and bachelors from software engineering) I told her I don't see reason why, and she immediately went onto a rant, how a week ago she saw list of people who live in our apartment building and everyone has their titles there. She even started to name the people individualy together with their titles, sometimes with some derrogative words for people she dislikes. I waited for her to finish her rant and then told her, okay, but I am going now to my room, because my foot is hurting (I have medical reason that I am working on, but for now it hurts as if you step on lego every time). And she stops me, tells me to wait... and she continues ranting for a few more minutes. Aparently my ID upset her so much, that when my aunt came to visit, it was the first thing my grandmother told her when she sat down. And they both started to tell me off, for not putting it there. I am confused, it's not required by the government, and it's not as if I am a medical doctor or lawyer, like they are. Even though I find this situation silly...

My sister, Mel (early 20sF, fake name), unfortunately had to work as she works in the service industry and have no way of getting even a half day off. So she came back after a 8-9hrs shift to a jam packed house of party. While our parents, other siblings and I were still on kitchen/hosting duty, Mom immediately asked for her to help out some stuff. I asked her if I should go but she said its fine and went with whatever needed help in. After awhile, the kitchen work toned down and she went pass me into my room. Many friends and extended family was asking for her as it is the first year after many years they didn't see each other. But didn't dare to enter our rooms to bother her.I went to check her out as our parents was asking for her to come greet her elders and whatsoever. She was sitting on the floor by the desk using phone with the chair and bed covering the view to her. Before I even spoke, she looked up with teary eyes and told me that outside is a bit overwhelming for her at the moment and would like quiet time abit if possible. She wanted to borrow my room since people might keep looking for her in her room.So I asked if she wants me to close the door so she doesn't have to use the furniture to hide. She nodded at me and I went out doing so. Mom was like ""Where is she?"" Which I just replied, ""She's tired, let her rest abit."" Since I know Mom doesn't understand the burnout she might have, coming home after a full day of interaction-work to face a crowd once again at home. Mom shrugged off but Dad was somewhat furious. Mel used to have bad tendencies when she locked herself in the room before but that was more than 10 years ago things and in fact she has better coping skills than me now. I trust her to be by herself a long time ago. However, Dad chewed me out for it and told me not to leave her alone. (We spoke privately for this). So what I did was went back in, asked her if she wants me in, she said no. So I went out and told Dad she doesn't want it and we shouldn't push her. Luckily Dad didn't go further and went to entertain his friends. Mel came out soon after, muttered a thanks to me and went on without a issue. I definitely had some doubts after the party since what Dad was concerned about wasn't wrong but I don't think I should intrude her personal space.

10vfio8,36,"I was at a waterpark with my son and we were ready to leave so we proceeded towards the family restroom/changing room. There were 2 private restrooms that were currently being used and there was a woman and her child standing in front of one of the bathrooms waiting to use it. I proceeded to stand in front of the other bathroom. I did not speak to the woman while we were waiting but we were both standing there for a good while, I would say 5-7 minutes. During this time a worker came up and stood between the 2 bathrooms facing us as though he was waiting to run in to clean or restock one or both of the restrooms once they became free. He was pleasant and smiling/talking to my son and the woman's son while we waited. My restroom became free first and my son and I proceeded in. We took a little while as we were changing out of our wet clothes into dry clothes, I would say probably another 5 to 7 minutes. When we exited the bathroom, the woman who had been waiting for the other restroom was next in line for my restroom and as she was passing me she began scolding me for cutting her in line and that I was teaching my son bad habits.I just kind of stared at her in shock speechless because she can't possibly be talking to me right?? We were both standing here waiting for these restrooms for a long time and never had she suggested 1 line for both restrooms. I figured the worker probably proceeded to clean the other restroom once it became free forcing the woman to have to wait for my restroom which I'm sure was very annoying for her since she had been waiting longer but how was I supposed to know that's what was going down? The worker never said anything to us about that while we were waiting. Anyways I felt bad but also irritated that she had been so confrontational towards me in front of my son who was also confused saying ""but we didn't cut her in line!""

10vdptx,19,"EDIT: Forgot to add the part ab the restrictions :,DI [15 F] got a new iPad for Christmas. Seeing as I just got a new one, I gave my old iPad to my little sister. [12 F] She has a lot of fun with it, I kept some of the apps she liked on it and allowed her to download new ones. Recently she downloaded Roblox, which in my family isn’t exactly allowed. I only have it because the girl I babysit likes to play with me when I’m over at her house. She quickly became obsessed with this game called Adopt Me, and when I had my friend over asked me to give her money so she could buy Robux for the game. I said no, because the iPad was still hooked up to my apple account. (I tried to sign into hers but we don’t know the password.) Even my friend kind of backed me up. She was upset but accepted it. Fast forward a couple hours, I was having dinner and playing some mindless phone game when I got a notification that someone had bought something off my apple account. I opened it quickly and it showed that my balance was now at $65 (I had about $80 I think?) and that someone had bought $15 dollars worth of Robux. It wasn’t that much money, but I save up my apple money in case I need to get myself out of a situation, like if I lost my Duolingo streak or if I need to buy something out with my friends. So I confronted her about it and she said she put a gift card in, which she didn’t because I would’ve seen that too. She was in the shower so I planned to talk with her when she got out. My mom went to talk with her and came out saying, “she didn’t know how much she was spending,” which didn’t make sense to me. I had told her not to spend anything?? My sister also accused me of being mean and not letting her buy something and that I owed her money anyways. This isn’t true, I buy her IAP’s for her games when she asks, (roblox is out of the question because I know how addicted kids get to buying Robux) and recently bought her a $40 sims pack as a surprise. (If I’m the AH for anything, make it for paying full price for a sims 4 dlc.) I made it so she can’t make IAP’s anymore and has to put my password in before she buys/downloads anything.

10vcbdh,18,"Alright, so I have a best friend named Sarah. We’re both 16 and we’re practically inseparable. Typically we hang out after school at my house. This is because Sarah’s sister, Ally (12), is a pain in the ass. Alli is very awkward and simultaneously wants to be around me but not talk much if at all. She usually will just stare and it makes me uncomfortable. She’s also oddly sensitive to scents. Like I can’t wear my perfume around her because it’s “too strong “. She has a lot of quirks that me and Sarah call Allyisms. The most annoying being her tendency to make random noises especially when she’s upset or her fascination with stuff I leave in the guest bedroom.Well work is currently being done on my parents house so this past Friday i spent the night at Sarahs house. As soon as I come over Ally is super excited for whatever reason. She gives me another low effort drawing of all of us playing together and ofc I pretend to love it. After I take my sweater off cause it’s 1000 degrees at their place, Ally lectures me about how my top is inappropriate. I says she’s being a prude and she drops the issue. I also made the mistake of wearing a new perfume I got for Christmas. Well upon their mom’s request I hopped in the shower to wash it off. While I was drying off Ally just waltzes right into the bathroom!! Rather than leave immediately she froze up and started making noises and mumbling. I literally had to push her out of the bathroom!! I confronted her afterwards and all she did was continue to mumble incoherently. I obviously got pissed and started yelling at her. She broke down crying and ran off. She avoided me the rest of the weekend and it was pretty awesome. I told Sarah what happened and she said i totally overreacted. Sarah said that her sister obviously didn’t mean anything bad and that I should be more understanding. Ally must’ve told her mom what happened later after I left because this morning Sarah said her mom doesn’t want me coming over for awhile.

10vbtb5,78,"I (21F) live with Gina (22F) and Belle (19F). Belle moved in two weeks ago due to problems with the room she was renting at the time and was moved to a unit of equal value that had availability, which ended up being the extra room in mine and Gina’s unit. Belle is sweet, tidy, quiet, and all around a nice roommate so far, but apparently I upset her the other day. Here’s what happened.For some context, I work at a chain thrift store in the town I live in. Despite it not being the only thrift store here, it’s the most popular, so I stay pretty busy. I work 8:30-5:00, typically 5 days a week, sometimes 6. When Belle moved in, we all introduced ourselves to each other and discussed where we worked and what we were studying in college (or what I used to study, in my case, as I no longer attend). Belle asked if I ever found anything good while working and I said yes, and then she asked if I donated myself, to which I said yes as well. I cleaned my closet and donated a LOT of clothes back in the fall. I still take a couple things now and then. Last Thursday night, Belle came to me with a couple shoe boxes and asked if I could take them to work with me in the morning. I honestly didn’t want to. I asked why she couldn’t take them, and she said she’s too busy during the day with classes and her job to come by. I tried to be polite and told her if she can’t bring them while we’re open, we have an easily accessible chute for after hours donations that she can put stuff into at any time of the day during any day of the week. She replied that she’d probably just forget whenever she actually had the time and said “it’s just a couple bags plus these shoes. I can help you put them in your car now if you want.” At this point I’m getting more frustrated, and I remind her we have the after hours chute that she can use. I then add that Fridays (the next day) are the busiest of the entire week and that my manager probably wouldn’t appreciate me bringing my own donations. Belle insists it won’t be a big deal and that I can just tell my boss it’s hers and not mine, and I tell her I think it would be better if she took it herself. She once again said she didn’t have time, and I said “maybe you should make time, then”. Belle said “uh, fine, okay,” and went back into her room. I haven’t seen her since, and the next afternoon when I saw Gina in the kitchen she asked me if I’d done anything to piss Belle off because she apparently heard her talking angrily on the phone and saying my name. It’s Monday now and I still haven’t seen anything of Belle and her donated clothes were sitting next to the door this morning where we usually out boxes for the dumpster and stuff. I don’t know, was I the AH here?***Edit- one other thing I told her that I had to remove bc of character count was that my boss had specifically told us if we’re gonna bring our own hauls or donations for friends to not do so on Friday and Saturday bc they’re such busy days for us. My boss would have been legitimately upset with me and it could have put me in bad standing or gotten me into trouble and Belle still insisted I take the donations Friday and that “my boss won’t care”.Edit 2- Just want to answer some questions/clarify things that keep coming up, some of which I covered in the post originally but had to cut out due to the character limit.“Why didn’t you want to take her donations” I don’t want to become responsible or expected to take Belle’s things whenever she wants me to just because “I’m already going there.” I don’t mind the occasional thing or two, but she was giving me a legitimate haul consisting of two boxes of sneakers and two fifteen gallon trash bags of clothes that were very heavy when I tried to lift one to check.“Why not just keep them in your car until Monday if you couldn’t bring them in on Friday/Saturday?” Her donations took up the remainder of the room inside my car, and I needed that room for my groceries. I go shopping for food and household needs on weekends after I get paid. My car is a mess, which is something I need to take care of, but it’s honestly hard to find the energy on Sundays when I’m just trying to get my laundry/food prep done and recover from the week I just worked. “Why do you think taking Belle’s clothes one time is going to turn into a trend?” I have had people do it to me before and I’m not keen on having it happen again. People have taken advantage of my kindness my whole life and it’s very draining to feel like you can never say no to people regardless of what it is and be punished when you don’t want to take on responsibilities for others. It’s also something that Belle and I already have a problem with, as she expects me to practically write her papers for her at this point. I told her when she moved in that I used to be an English major, and she was quick to request my help with an essay. I honestly despise essays and research papers (I’m more into literature analysis and creative writing) but I’m very good with grammar, spelling, sentence structure, etc, which were the things Belle said she had major problems with. While helping her with the first paper, any sentences I told her that needed to be reworded she asked that I rewrite them myself. I gave her some corrected examples, but she continued to request that I just “do it for her since I’m better at it.” I tried to be as nice as I could while telling her the best way to get better is if she practices herself. She didn’t seem happy with that but she went along with it. The next paper she asked for help with, only three days after that first one, she asked if I would write her thesis for her because she “just couldn’t figure it out.” I tried to give her some examples, but she once again requested I do the work for her and allow her to take credit. She also asked afterwords if I would go in and out her citations in the right place and format for her. I made up an excuse for being busy and left. I don’t mind helping, but I didn’t get an apartment with roommates so I could do someone’s homework for them. Because of the way this turned out, I expected the same kind of issue with taking her donations.“Why doesn’t your manager want you bringing in donations on Fridays/Saturdays? Doesn’t she want more business?” To be quite honest, I don’t exactly know why she’s pretty much banned the employees bringing donations on Friday and Saturday. I would assume that her thinking is if she allows us to bring a couple things, it will slowly turn into more and more. But as far as business, like I said, Friday is our busiest day. We get more business than we can handle. This issue is, it’s all in the front, because we don’t make money while processing the donations. We only make money of what we can tag and put out, which is far less than what we actually receive in. People often donate literal trash, objects or clothes damaged beyond what we’re allowed to sell, or items we can’t legally sell and have to then legally break down and dispose of, which takes a lot of time and effort. Because of this, we have one employee that works the front and deals with all of the customers and transactions, and the rest of us have to be in the back processing, pricing, and putting out inventory as well as disposing of unsellable and hazardous materials. We almost always end up with more donations to process than we can handle, and have things leftover from Friday that we have to process on Saturday, which is also very busy. If we finish everything by the end of Saturday, we often come in on Monday to the back door, loading dock, and chute overflowing with donations, and often times they are also strewn about by people who have shown up to pick through things and go through our dumpster. Its busy, it’s fast paced, and it’s exhausting.“It sounds like you don’t like this job. Why don’t you quit?” If I quit right now I would be homeless before I could manage to get another job. I put in countless apps across a three month period and had only three places get back to me.

10ve0sm,14,"About eight months ago I (22F) started working my first job after uni. There I met my colleague Julia (27F) who really helped me navigate the new job. Most of our coworkers are men in their 40s, which I think is why she took under her wing. About two months ago (at a lunch gathering) she announced that she was pregnant and mentioned wanting to throw a baby shower. She insinuated that we'd all be invited and we casually agreed to come. She spent the next couple of weeks hinting at what she was planning and tbh it was a lot bigger than I expected. She even mentioned two of her cousins flying in from Asia. All of this made me dread the event a bit since I don't do well with big parties. Also I am not used to 'fancy' parties since I'm from a working class background. I'm not sure I'd know how to behave. Still I was planning on going.Last week I received the 'formal' invitation. The invitation mentioned several things that made me uncomfortable and made it so that I really don't want to attend.1. There was no plus one (as far as I can tell all my colleagues got one) even though I've been with my boyfriend for three years (lived with him for two). 2. The location of the shower is a two hour drive away and in the middle of nowhere. I don't have a car and would have to borrow my boyfriends. Tbh, I don't really feel very safe driving outside a city environment and haven't done so in two years. I'm not particularly close to any of my other coworkers (yet) so I'm a bit nervous to ask any of them to drive me since all of them seem to plan to drive there independently. As far as I know none of them live close to where I do either.3. The party has a very strict dress code. Women are supposed to wear 'light pink formal dresses'. I'm a bit of a tomboy and only own one (black) dress that I mostly wear to old/conservative relatives birthday parties. The invite also mentions 'proper' hair and makeup. I honestly haven't worn and don't own any makeup so I'm not really sure what to do. I also always wear my hair in a simple ponytail. Not only do I feel pretty uncomfortable with the idea of wearing all that, I think it's going to be expensive and I really don't have much disposable income at the moment. 4. This is by far the least important part but tbh the fact that there is going to be a 'gender reveal' at the party makes me uncomfortable. I believe that gender is not determined by birth and have several friends who have had to deal with very ignorant parents on the topic. She specifically mentioned to a group of colleagues who asked why she had written that she had a preference for cash gifts it was because she ""didn't want to be gifted a bunch of pink clothes and then find out she was having a boy and needing to donate them"". She also mentioned some sort of 'price' for guests who guess the gender correctly.So Reddit, would I be the Asshole if I said no to going to the shower (even though I had agreed to it two months ago and she has helped me so much)?",WIBTA for refusing to go to my colleagues baby shower?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ve0sm/wibta_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_colleagues_baby/

But at the same time if I help my friends friend and they get the job over my girlfriend I would also feel like shit.So I come to this sub for judgement. Would I be the asshole if I refused to help the other person and just prepare my girlfriend for the interview?Edit: Just realized the title implies I run the company or can affect the outcome of the interview.

10vg1mg,7,"Last weekend my friend and I went out for drinks at a bar we go to all the time. The drinks are always good and so we always leave a tip. However, the drinks were really terrible for some reason last weekend. They just tasted awful. So we paid for the drinks we ordered and left. We also didn’t make a scene or anything. We were really nice about it and quietly left. Tipping is completely optional at this bar by the way as it is in most places.But as we were leaving the bar, the bar tender chased us down and confronted us. She demanded to know why we didn’t leave a tip. She told us we should have given her a tip because she offered to give us the drinks for free. Yes she offered but we declined and paid for the drinks anyway. We felt guilty for not liking the drinks because we know how much effort it takes to make each drink. We PAID for every single drink we ordered. We just chose not to leave a tip. Our experience wasn’t a good as the other times. The bar tender made me and my friend so uncomfortable.

I know he doesn't have a job but I just don't want him to not do anything... I pushed him to pass his driver's licence which he is doing now and it's a very good thing.I don't care that he doesnt have a job as long as he has plans, even personnal things. It's fine with me as long as he really tries things and that he doesn't ""stagnate"".&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;Today was the first day of my new job because I changed my internship It all went very well and my previous job was very far away from my appartment and I had one and a half hour of public transport so i got back around 7:30 pm and was very tired.Today I was very happy and excited to get back at 5:20 pm and see my boyfriend earlier than usual. When I got back he wasn't there so i was kind of sad and worried because he didnt warn me, so I called a lot of times and he was at his driving lesson so I said ok call me back when you can.He called me a few minutes later when he finished his lesson and said he was coming home, and we hung up. I texted him the grocery shopping list and said that we could go together but then I texted ""whatever just get back home we can eat what's left in the fridge"", because I wanted him home as soon as possible.He didn't answer anything and I waited for him an hour or more.He then got back with half of the groceries i texted (not even enough for me to cook) and lots of candies and ice cream and said he didn't find the rest (the rest = meet and mushroom. They are easy to find)I started to get angry at him and I went to the kitchen to cook pasta and realized he didn't do the dishes, so I had to cook in a smaller pan and I made a mess.He also didn't do the laundry (the only thing I asked him today).So I screamed everything that I was mad about and I was so angry that I cried. Ifinished cooking and gave him his plate and went to eat alone because I was so mad and he kept coming to speak to me even tho I already told him everything that made me mad and that I just wanted to eat alone. So him not respecting my boundaries also made me so angry. Because I have a hard time controling my anger. So I just wanted alone time to ""decompress"" and he didn't let me.I think he didn't even eat what i cooked and he went alone in the bathroom to let me know he didn'tfeel good.I feel so mad because I was so happy to finish work early and now I just feel stupid because it didn't change anything. I have a job and he doesn't so he should be able to do things while I'm at work.

10vcspw,12,"My boyfriend (31M) and I (26 F) have been together for 3 years. My boyfriend has a dog, a small Pinscher, Gina, whom he got a little before we started dating, when she was around 3. She is a rescue, had a history of abuse and is very easily stressed. To get her to be sociable, he did his best to train her. She couldn't even walk without freezing up when she heard sharp sounds (even the sound of her own leash scared her) so my boyfriend carried her in his lap, calmed her down and started over. She is now very happy and very sociable both with dogs and other humans. Gina can now be trusted to be alone for longer hours (his regular working hours) without concerns for her psychological and physical well being, or worries she might make a mess or stress-chew on furniture. However, she is still a somewhat anxious dog who needs attention. Gina eats twice per day, once at 9am and next at 8 pm. She usually gets 2 walks per day, but it's not uncommon for her to go out for a third time.Yesterday, my boyfriend and I left his house at around 2:30 pm. We don't live together, but I have keys to his apartment. He was going to a friend's house, three minutes from his own (literally two streets down) to help a friend with some chores. I was also visiting  a friend and later headed back to my own place.We texted in between the day. He also texted me around midnight, when he was about to go home. Surprised, I asked him if he had gone home to feed his dog and take her out for her walk. He said he hadn't. I was astounded and kind of mad, it seemed very insensitive to me, but didn't say anything other than that if he was really busy, he could have called me and asked me to go. He said I was right but he was getting home soon. I didn't reply to him, so he kept texting me telling me that she was fine, he had given her more food to compensate and that he was taking her on a big walk. I didn't say anything else, but I just keep thinking about her alone in the apartment, hungry and waiting. I guess this isn't a huge waiting time (4 hours later than her usual time of dinner)and it might not be my place as I am not myself a dog owner,  but it just bugs me that he was literally three minutes away and didn't bother to check up on his dog for 10 hours straight, without a huge obligation weighing on him.WIBTA if I told him off about leaving his dog waiting?",WIBTA if i told off my boyfriend for the way he acted towards his dog?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vcspw/wibta_if_i_told_off_my_boyfriend_for_the_way_he/

Neither of us ever dreamed of a big wedding and we both don’t want to spend an obscene amount of money on one day in our lives. Since getting engaged, we’ve bought 2 houses, and are going on our 2nd international trip in a few months. That’s what we’ve spent our money on instead of a wedding. Now we’re getting to the point of wanting to have a baby. I won’t have kids until we’re married. We’re planning an elopement/destination wedding in June of 2024 but at this point I just want to be his wife. We’ve been talking about getting married at the courthouse in the near future to make it official, and then planning the celebration for later.I confessed this to my mother-in-law this morning and she immediately started crying and told me how upset and hurt she’d be if we didn’t let her come to the courthouse with us. She tends to have a flair for the dramatic but on this issue I’m absolutely positive I’d never hear the end of it. My relationship with her was pretty strained at the beginning of my fiancé and I’s relationship, and it’s better now, and I don’t want to ruin that. But I also am a very private person. I want to marry my husband and I believe that with something as simple as a courthouse ceremony, I want this to be between he and I and no one else.

I sent out so dates that I am available to me and my fiancés (32m) immediate family. I reached out to my sister (34) separately, about a week ago, and she said that she is “free every weekend except the middle of February.” My mom (58) said that only one date worked for her and my fiancés family said they didn’t care they just wanted to celebrate us. This passed Saturday my mom picked a date and we called and made reservations and we were all super excited to finally celebrate all of our families coming together and meeting for the first time. Sunday, my sister sent out a group text saying she was going out of town to pick up the crib for her baby (she is due in late September) and won’t be back until mid April. She said it’s still “up for debate” and “unsure of details” since her husbands (38) mom (61) hasn’t made any concrete plans to come up the weekend of our planned engagement dinner. I told my sister it would mean a lot if she was there because our families have never met and if she could go another weekend. My mom texted me separately saying I need to change the date and that I was being “rigid” since I only said I could do one day. I said it’s fine if my sister can’t come it’s just weird that she was free until the final plan came out that now she can’t.I said that I can’t change the plans now because 1. We already made reservations (for a big group, which is already hard as it is). 2. Everyone the day before was in agreement with the date. And 3. Is it really important to get the crib in April when the baby isn’t due until September (this may be where I am the AH- or any part since brides can be AH)Also side story, my fiancé told my sister when he was going to propose and the day before he did, she told my parents that she was pregnant - which I didn’t think much of at the time but my friends all think she’s the AH for not waiting since she was aware of the date of the engagement.

10ve8jp,10,"I (22F) took my (ex)friend (21F) to an inpatient program in October of 2021 and it has completely blown up in my face. For context, this person, who we will call Karol, lives with two roommates she hates. When I say hate, I mean when she cries, she has to cry by the dumpsters because if she cries in her apartment, her roommates will make fun of her for being a crybaby. I set her up in a private room at my work because she didn’t want her roommates to hear her talk about them in therapy.In October, she broke it off with her girlfriend(20F) of two months who I am also close to. It was a very mutual break up as Karol couldn’t provide this ex enough time or energy due to her mental health. She’s complained about living with her roommates for as long as I have known her and I could compile a series of books of just the texts she has sent me about them. Karol’s mental health was getting more worrisome and texted me that she felt that she would be “better off dead.” Personally, I’ve had family with extensive history in inpatient psychiatric care and I’m not the biggest fan of those systems, but I was really worried. I talked to her ex about this and she was also worried and agreed that I should bring up inpatient care. I had Karol come to my office and I explained inpatient and outpatient programs and where they would be and what they would do. After some discussion, we went to her apartment and grabbed some stuff and left for an inpatient program together. After, Anna sent me a long DM about how I “conspired with her ex gf to put her in the mental hospital” and I just blocked her.Months later (February), her roommate Anna, is in one of my classes and although it’s definitely weird, I just let it be. I think we may have made eye contact like once or twice accidentally. Three weeks into the semester, she walks by my seat and says “you left something at our apartment a while ago” and gives me a piece of paper. Being the gullible idiot I am, I take it and say “thank you” because it was kind of her to give it back to me. It was the hospital bill for Karol’s stay. Also, again Karol does not pay any bills or have any way of making her own money and exclusively uses her parents’ money so she wouldn’t even be responsible for paying the bill. Because it was the beginning of class, I just turned around and told Anna “you’re funny” and she responded “well, you’re the one who forced her to go there.” Mind you, she could have been involuntarily admitted. I could’ve called 911 after that message, but we went together on public transit after picking up her stuff from her apartment. Honestly, I am just in disbelief at this situation. If anything, that was one of the hardest weeks of my life and I am willing to put it behind me. For Anna and Karol to not only come up with this insane theory that I forced Karol to go to the hospital in an effort to get her and her ex back together but also to keep it up for so long and harass me with it in class?

My mother (55F) lives in the town and when she separated from my father more than 15 years ago it was traumatic for all of us. My mom's family turned their backs on her for separating from a Catholic marriage just because my father (65M) was unfaithful (sarcasm).We have a somewhat strained relationship because my mother is very religious and Im not. My sister is in the middle. My sister and I dont approve of her new relationship but we respect her. My mother's boyfriend (48M) has been with her for 7 years. He is different than my father, as he is not educated, has no steady job and has two children from prev marriage. He is very religious, drops ignorant and conservative comments. My mother loves him and doesnt understand that his attitudes are not welcomed by us, she says that we cant understand him.Today my mother gathered my sister and me to ask us, if we would be okay with her marrying her boyfriend. She says that living out of wedlock, her morality does not allow her to take communion and that emotionally she feels very bad about not doing so. The options the priest gave her were to marry or break up with her boyfriend. My sister burst into tears, said she completely disagreed with the marriage, she fears that the same thing will happen again as during the divorce with my father. My mother suffered a lot during the divorce, financial uncertainty, therapy, a physical fight, depression, all the pack.I told her that I didn't think it was sufficient justification for not being able to receive communion, the fact is that she wants to get married. I didn't agree, but I understood if she got married anyway, she is older and deserves to be happy in a relationship. I told her that whether she marries or not, my only condition for supporting her is to guarantee that she will legally maintain her finances apart from her boyfriend, she needs to guarantee a secure and comfortable old age, I do not want her boyfriend to take away the business she has built and her house.She told me that if I was worried about my inheritance. I am legally responsible for my sister because of her disability, so all the inheritance would be handled by me. I told her that I was not interested in her money or the inheritance, I have my own business, my own home (fully adapted for my sister's disability) and I support my sister.

I think he always wanted a girly girl and she was like a boy in every way except biologically. They didn’t have a good relationship and fought all the time. Our dad would make remarks about her not taking care of her appearance and running around all day and tanning dark in the process. My room was directly next to the living room and I would listen to my parents complaining to each other about my sister’s future and how no one would want to marry her because she’s nothing like a girl. Then my sister wanted to be geologist like my dad and wanted to study geology in uni. She always loved rocks and collected rocks growing up. Our dad told her geologists got laid off all the time and the pay sucked to try to get her to choose something else. She was convinced to do teaching probably because it was a female profession but after first year she dropped out because she HATED it. Then she took a year off and got involved with a tech start up. Loved it and went back to university to do a degree in compute science. Our parents told her they would pay for the year of the education degree she did but they wouldn’t pay for the compute science degree because they had some financial problems.A year after she graduated I started a degree in geology and our parents said they would pay for my entire degree. This is a few months after they told her they couldn’t pay for her degree so she had to pay off her loans herself. I knew it was probably because they didn’t like her profession but didn’t say anything until she asked.  She did probably because she the same suspicions as me. Our parents always said we were guaranteed our undergrad paid for and as soon as she did a computer science degree they go back on their word?

Since I'm the older one, I've always have to do more chores, and have to reach higher grades than B, but it's normal because I'm the oldest. My parents always expect me to act like an adulte. Today, B had a friend over, C (13F). Important thing to say is that when she is in public, B can act like a spoiled little princess, and expect me to do everything for her (it's also like that in private, but in public she is much more disrespectful). So I did all of the houses chores, since my parents were at work and B and I are on vacation, and light up the fire place. I then make lunch for B, C and for me, an after eating, I get to my room to do my homeworks. Before that, I specially go outside to get a couple of logs for B because I asked her to please, watch the fireplace since her and C were going to stay in the living room. But when my father (43M) and mother (44F) got home and I came to say hi, they began to yell at me because the fire was off, and the kitchen was a mess. When I look, I saw that B hasn't use any of the logs that I brought her, and that her and C, who has already left at the time, has baked something (I can't say what it was because it was completely barbecued) and left everything on the kitchen. I then explain to my parents that I did all the chores on the house, that it wasn't me that let the kitchen like that, and that I specifically asked B to watch the fireplace. But it turns out they already knew that and proceed to yell at me for not cleaning after my sister, and expecting her to clean. When I say that it wasn't fair at all and that I literally did everything while she was with her friends watching TV, they got even more mad and told me that since I'm the oldest it's my job, and that I was being an ingratefull and spoiled little brat. They say they expect me to apologize to B for asking her to watch the fireplace, and give up my phone and computer for two weeks as punishment.

My mom then sighed and got annoyed at the confrontation and I asked her not to sigh because this was genuinely something I wanted to witness with my own eyes rather than a video. I do know that this moment will surely happen again, but my mom became a bit of a bitch, acting as if I’m fucking crazy for saying I really wanted to see this, and me physically seeing this would have been special to me and more important than her video.

10ved86,27," My (27) wife and I are celebrating our five year anniversary tonight and we made reservations to do a super fun activity like three months ago. We have a 12 week old daughter for whom we needed to find a babysitter for the time we would be out; 6:45pm - 11:30pm. As it turns out all of our usual babysitters are out of town tonight so I reached out to my older sister (35) to ask if we can leave our baby daughter by her house for that time. I said that she is generally a well behaved baby but there is no guarantee that shell be asleep by 10pm which is my sister's usual bedtime. Add to this that my sister and her husband have four sons ranging between the ages of 16yo - 4yo and she is currently pregnant with her fifth child and she is in her ninth month.By way of background, throughout all of the years my sister had her children and I was not yet married I was always available to help her out with her kids. I picked them up from school and sitter more times than I can remember. I came over to tutor them in math and help them with their school work. I babysat them at nights and on three separate occasions. I actually moved into her house for a few days at a shot. I even moved into their house once with my 6 month old son (he's 2 now).All the while we never complained and we were happy to do it because family is family. At the same time, my sister did not have many opportunities to reciprocate because my needs were always so much less than hers. I used her netflix account for years and I would often come visit her house when I needed a place to relax. I put my son to sleep by her twice over the last year and she picked my son up from daycare once. I am not trying to be tit for tat but I just want to paint a picture about how this relationship has worked. We are very close.So back to my story, I ask her if I can leave my 12 week old daughter with her and she tells me in no uncertain terms (but very nicely) ""I need my sleep so if you want to leave her here until 10:00 you can."" I passive aggressively responded to her ""most babies are born sleep trained and go to sleep at around 10:00 so you having a baby soon won't pose any problem for you."" She got upset with me and told me I was making her feel bad that she needed sleep. I responded that given how much I had done for her over the years I was hurt that she couldn't give up an extra hour and half of her sleep to help me out even though she is in her ninth month.She wants me to apologize but I think I did nothing wrong.

So I did and I’m pretty sure that they left to go home after stepping away from the stage but that’s not what I’m here to talk about.so as I already said, I was sitting next to Lexi she was talking to one of her friends saying stuff like “I just got second hand embarrassment“ and that my former friend was a “horrible singer“ it was just back and fourth non stop shit talk about my former friend, and now I feel really bad for being nosy and stuff and my friends that I told are calling me an asswholehelp me Reddit, am I the asswhole?",AITA for looking over my replacements shoulder and reading her text message conversations?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vdqt6/aita_for_looking_over_my_replacements_shoulder/
10vdp2s,5,"I (37f) just married my husband, Jushin (39m) in November. We had been together 10 years before he proposed and decided that an expensive wedding wouldn't make sense.My (ex)best-friend (37f), Gracie and her husband, Khaden (39m), accepted being part of the bridal party. They had been having their own financial issues for some time, and she had come to me here and there for loans, but I did not mind or care, because she was my best friend and I felt she deserved the world.My (then) fiancé had been hanging out at our place with Gracie's husband one day, and Khaden asked and said some things about our financial situation. Things like, we probably would not be able to afford our new home if something happened to our jobs and that we had jumped into living at our new place too soon. He also bragged about being able to save money because his rent was in the low hundreds. He later also asked Jushin if he had cheated on me at any point, to which Jushin said, ""No"". Khaden kept pushing by saying, ""Well, you know I wouldn't care if you did, right?"" Jushin still said he had never cheated, and the matter was dropped. When my fiancé spoke to me later, he asked if I had put Khaden up to the task of testing him, and I vehemently denied even knowing what he was talking about. When he explained, I got upset, but we decided to leave it alone for the time being.Leading up to the wedding, Gracie was a great bridesmaid. She was there for each event and went out of her way to help decorate. Everything was great.The bridesmaids dresses were fairly cheap, and she was able to purchase one for herself. The suits for the groomsmen, were a little bit more expensive, but the guys were able to pay for them in installments. The issue began when Jushin had found out from the suit tailor that Khaden had not even gone to get measured and we were two weeks away from the wedding. This made Jushin upset, but he reached out to Khaden, who said he would take care of it. I decided to reach out to Gracie to ask her what was going on, and she said that she would set up the appointment, but Khaden later came back with a text (not a call) laying out all the things he had had to pay for saying that he wouldn't have the money until that Friday, but it wasn't guaranteed. My fiancé was confused by this, but asked Khaden to keep him posted.When I spoke to Gracie, she confronted me saying that Jushin and I should have known that Khaden was asking for help financially. Nowhere in the text did he ask for help. She was upset with us and explained that their finances were a sensitive topic and that we should have understood what he needed. I was confused by this because he had just been talking about how well he was doing. This conversation went on for hours, and I told her that I would lend her the money.AITA for not telling my (ex) best friend that her husband is an a\*\*hole?ETA: Just before the wedding day, at a group meeting, Jushin was discussing his stress with another groomsman, to which Khaden said that he should relax. Jushin cussed at Khaden saying that he was only adding to his stress over the effing suit. Jushin then realized that Khaden's boys were playing nearby, and he apologized for swearing. Khaden said it was alright, but later sent a long text (no call) about feeling disrespected and needing to hold his tongue. Jushin tried to call Khaden to apologize, but he ignored him for two days.When I spoke to Gracie about it, I apologized for Jushin's swearing and said it was inappropriate, but Khaden wouldn't even speak to him. Gracie said that Khaden was in pain and could not talk. WHAT? I believed it was a cop out, but I left it, and the guys decided that they would leave well enough alone.Day of the wedding, everything goes well, until after reception time. The Master of Ceremony spoke to some of the wedding party, asking how they knew the bride and groom, and Khaden's answer was, ""I don't know them, and I don't know why I'm here."" She told us about his answer and I was hurt. I thought to talk to Gracie about it, but decided it wasn't the day. I just briefly explained to her that I think we should have a talk about something that the MC told us.The day after the wedding, one of my bridesmaids, Holly, told me that Khaden had been talking to her best friend, Kara, and he had told Kara that he and Gracie were actually divorced and that he regretted having children. He also messaged her the day after the wedding, asking her to hang out. I did not want to be involved in the foolishness, especially since I believed that Gracie was going to believe and defend Khaden no matter what he said, and I would be seen as the hating friend who was trying to break them up.Fast forward to the day after Jushin and I returned from our honeymoon, I reach out to Gracie and she asks me what happened after the wedding. She explained that she had been looking for Khaden during the wedding and found him talking to another girl in her car. I did not want to tell her what I had heard, but she pulled it out of me. She was upset that I had not told her, but I explained to her that I did not want to be involved and that she was going to defend Khaden no matter what. She was more upset with me than with the person causing all of the drama.",AITA for not telling my best friend that her husband is an a-hole?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vdp2s/aita_for_not_telling_my_best_friend_that_her/
10vdny6,6,"I'll try to keep this as concise as possible because character limit. Any questions I will answer.So our main DM who I'll call V (18M), has invented a new way to play the game, called ""small-shots"". Basically, it's a series of small one-shots that functions as a campaign where anyone can play and anyone can DM. Imagine a huge campaign divided in 2-hour long games; a player can participate if they want to, just as how they can chose not to, and nothing will change. Think it as being individual missions published in a mission board: Any adventurer can take them up or they can pass. Everything is happening in the same world, so there's continuity in every mission. In this game mode, you as a player can have more than one character you can use for the small-shots (for clarification, you can only take one at a time).So, back on theme. V's girlfriend, M, has been playing with us for a bit over a year, and logically has amassed a good amount of characters for herself. In our DnD group, there's a good amount of artists, including me and our DM, and I'd say M is one of the most experienced ones, so it's no surprise that M came up with the designs and drew all of her characters herself.This takes us to the situation at hand. We were hanging out and talking about DnD with V, M, and two other DnD players, N and Z. M bought up that she had been working in a new character and that she finally did a drawing of her. She then pulled out her phone to show us, and  let me tell you, this character looked EXACTLY like this other somewhat popular videogame character. I mean, it was basically a ripoff. Something to highlight is that it was definitely her drawing, and it WAS a very good drawing, there's no denying that. However, the design was the one that called my attention. I mean, the clothes were different, it was completely her design and i can accept that, the hairstyle was slightly changed as well as the colors, but everything else was exactly like this other character. So I said ""But that's just the character from ""X"" videogame!"". M kinda laughed it off but I insisted that everything was exactly like this other character, because I mean it's true. Then N and Z changed the subject and we left it at that. The day after, V contacted me and tore me a new one saying that I acted like a dick and that I was out of line being so insistent. M puts a lot of effort in all of her characters and this new one she's been working on for months; she's mentioning completely changing her design now because she feels its not original enough.Now I agree that she comes up with amazing concepts and designs. Her first ever DnD character is a Spirits Bard that's a runaway messiah of his own religion who's chained to thousand of restless spirits and his design is one of the coolest I've ever seen. However, this new character just wasn't it.

10vdesw,13,"Last night I invited some friends over to my apartment and we were playing Tetris loudly. At approximately 10pm my upstairs neighbor called me. I ignored the call because I knew she was calling to complain about the noise, but I told my friends to lower their voices and we stopped playing. Then we started watching the new episode of “the last of us” which ended at around 12 and everyone left. When I woke up I saw she messaged the buildings group chat complaining about loud noises last night saying that I was “blasting my tv until 12”, that my dogs fight and make noise, that my roomate started talking on the phone and singing at 5am, and that she could smell weed coming through her window. I apologized and explained that my roomate works from home as a sales representative from 5am to 1pm and that my dogs sometimes growl while playing (they never fight).I think I’m in the wrong about the weed smell (even though it’s legal here) so I already bought a weed vaporizer to reduce it, and I’m gonna be smoking in a different area of my apartment. Regarding the talking, I told her there is not much my roomate can do, and she said he should close his window and lower his voice. Keep in mind that he doesn’t even talk loud, I’ve heard him answering calls and he just talks in a normal and clear voice. Also, right now it’s summer and we don’t have air conditioning so closing the window is not an option for him.Regarding my dogs I’m not sure what I can do to get them to stop playing and growling. Also, she has a little dog that always barks and cries when left alone, but I’ve never complained about it since it doesn’t bother me much. And I didn’t mention anything about the tv since we were watching the show at volume 20 (which in my tv is just loud enough to understand the show without subtitles).How should I handle the situation? I don’t want to keep giving her reasons to complain, but I only have one tv in my house and don’t know what to do about my dogs.Also, she keeps finding reasons to complain. 4 months ago she texted me saying that her car had a scratch and that it could’ve only been my fault since she parked outside, next to my garage. But in the 3 days her car was parked on the street I only used mine once and I didn’t scratch hers.",AITA for bothering my neighbor,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vdesw/aita_for_bothering_my_neighbor/

My aunt (moms stepsister) decided to throw her dad (my moms dad) a big surprise party for his 80th with all the family invited. He’s not in great health, and we all kind of know he probably won’t be with us much longer. Not sure why she wants it to be a surprise, that sounds like trouble to me, but not my call. The issue here is that they live about 11 hours from me and my family of 6, and my grandfather has made zero ZERO effort to connect with me and my family in years. Growing up I saw him maybe 6-7 times in about 15 years, and the only visit I remember is when his wife slapped me when I was 4 for touching her daughters doll. He and his wife came to my wedding, and even contributed to alcohol costs which was very generous, but didn’t really interact with us, and since haven’t visited, called, texted, nothing. I have reached out multiple times with no response, even expressed an interest in visiting their city and them and wasn’t even given the curtesy of a refusal, just silence. I personally do not want to go to the party. I gave up reaching out, he wasn’t really a grandfather to me growing up, and I’ll be honest, I don’t think I will be too upset when he passes. Cold? Maybe, but it’s the truth. I will, however, be upset for my mom, and I do know me not attending this party with my family will be upsetting for her and other family members. I feel torn, because I love my mama and I don’t want to hurt her, but I have no desire to spend money to go to a party for someone I just don’t really care about.

Yesterday, we were having dinner together + the awkwardness between them was becoming unbearable, so I tried starting a conversation between them.

10vfb04,14,"I know that sounds like an obvious no, but here is the back story. I (f30) make more money that my bf(31), I am not sure by how much, due to his fluctuating wkly checks, and I am usually not privy to what those checks are, as I try not to ask. Anywhere from $400-$1000 each week. I make around $135k per year.With that said, we both had some CC debt that we have been trying to catch up on, and I recently got a good amount back on my taxes so I was able to pay close to all of my personal debt off, and then we have a shared CC (under my name) that has about 9K on it, that I plan to focus on, and should be able to get it paid off completely in the next 4 monthsish.We use that card for groceries, some bills, and things we do together. We usually split the payment each month for the shared CC, although I still usually pay more, but he does contribute. Since I no longer have any debt on my card that I have alone, and he has his own CC debt that he hasn't been been able to pay much on, I told him that I will work to pay off the 9k, and he doesn't have to pay to it at all. All I ask is that we split rent and some utilities (me still paying more)I WFH and work out a lot, and I usually just wear workout clothes all day, so I wanted to buy a new set which cost me $150. He was not happy about this, and told me that I shouldn't have spent $150 when we are trying to save money (I have some money saved as well)And is basically saying that I shouldn't be ""living a lavish lifestyle when he cant"" I don't live a lavish lifestyle by any means. The most name brand stuff I buy on OCCASION is Lulu, but I don't buy anything designer. I shop amazon basically. Anyway, he said its not fair that I buy things for myself when he can't (I have offered and have bought things for him, he never likes it and just gets upset.) He said, that it's not fair that I spent money on Christmas on my son and my siblings and my parents, when he wasn't able to. Even though I said all of the presents were from us. He said he wants to save so we can travel, (which I will most likely pay most of anyway) nd I should not have spent 150.And I just am at a loss as to why, if I am paying for mostly everything, don't ask him to contribute, and if I were to? I am sure he would have something negative to say. I have even offered to help him pay off his CCs, but no matter what I do, or say in regards to money, he is upse. Offer to help him? Hes upset. pay for everything? upset and says that that makes him feel bad. k fine then, ask him to pay wtever hes comfortable with? upset because now he cant pay off his cc.Its like we are constantly in this cycle and nothing I do makes him happy. I feel defeated bc I am trying my best to make sure he dsn't feel bad about me making more money than him. I dn't ever use that as a way to have power over him, ever.

I made it clear that I wouldn't feel comfortable without them. The moment we landed, my female friend realized her former colleague lives in Havana. He's very attractive. This man accompanied us on all our group activities, plus took out my female friend separately. She said it wasn't romantic, but she was glued to his side of her every moment as if they were a couple. And the actual couple is in the honeymoon stage so spent the entire trip having hushed private conversations.So essentially, I ended up a FIFTH WHEEL instead! Much of the time I was trailing behind, feeling awkward. And they had their own agendas and schedules. ""We all have different reasons for being here."" I thought the reason was to celebrate my birthday! So of course there was a lot of splitting up. A few times they did accommodate my wishes, but several times I was told to go do my thing and we'll meet later at the Airbnb.I was so upset, I broke down in tears much of the trip. When I expressed my POV to them, I felt gaslighted. ""But we're not a couple!"" ""You can't expect me to spend 24/7 with you!"" ""I didn't realize this trip came with such a commitment!"" The commitment: hang out with me and include me in conversations and outings, and don't leave me alone on a 4-DAY TRIP!I even asked my female friend, once, gently via text, ""Do you think you can ask your friend to sit out this one last night so we can spend time together?"" She basically said no, he's coming with us. The next day, she made it seem like I yelled, ""Tell him to stay home! I don't want him here!"" I never did that. I communicated gently.She also spent 15 minutes berating me on a street corner. ""Yes, you invited me but I paid for my own trip!"" Translation: even though you invited me, I'm going to do what's most convenient for me, like hanging out with this hot guy who knows the ins and outs of Havana."" Now I'm told I was a drama queen, impossible to please, and that I made it an awful experience for everyone. My ""friendship"" with this female friend is over, and my relationship with my dear male friend is strained. As a final insult to injury, his Instagram post about Havana included pictures of everyone but me! When I confronted him about it, he said, ""Don't overthink it.""AITA?",AITA for for expecting my friends to prioritize me on my birthday trip to Cuba?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vez0b/aita_for_for_expecting_my_friends_to_prioritize/

Gary seems to have really hated the cats after he knew about this.my dads wife 'kate' (all fake names) is coming to the uk from her own country. she said she used to have a cat as a kid and is ok with the cats. my uncle insisted i get rid of the cats. he always asks me and my dad when we will get rid of them when he comes to our house and my dad said soon. a month before she was supposed to come, Gary's wife's aunt died in the other country but for some reason, Gary came to my house to pay respects instead of going to Gary's house. he keeps commenting on the cats and when we will get rid of them but now a few days before Kate comes, my uncle called me out of the blue (never usually calls) and asks me how i am and then quickly talked about getting rid of my cats and giving them to a shelter.Gary called my dad 2 days ago and asked and my dad was firm and said he wont be getting rid of them. today, my dad asked Gary about buying a radio and then Gary quickly talked about my cats. he said Kate is coming in 2 days and we need to get rid of them. he said when will you go to the shelter to give them away and my dad said no.Gary then insisted on getting rid of them. saying all sorts of excuses to get them out saying they smell and their cat tray smells (i scoop it everyday and they bury their waste) (and they dont smell as they are clean indoor cats). my dad then told him if he wanted them and Gary said no they smell. this is all my dad told me about their conversation and i feel like an asshole cause maybe i should get rid of them but i dont want to and i honestly see them as family.

People give me so much backlash for not being able to speak Spanish but to them I look Mexican.

10vmgzi,297,"For context, my brother (26m) and I (18f) have never gotten along. He’s hated me since before I was even born. He spent my entire childhood controlling everything I did, watched, and even ate. At Christmas he pissed me off. I was quite proud of myself for buying my first vehicle all on my own. He called my truck a POS. Then said to our parents, “Insurance companies statistically have higher rates for female drivers than males.” He was absolutely insinuating they shouldn’t put me on their policy. Simply because he’s been on their policy since he turned 16 and has never paid for insurance. He knew damn well he was getting bumped off when I was added. First of the year, our mom told him to get his own policy. He was pretty salty about that. Fast forward to this past weekend, it was our dad’s birthday. Honestly, I didn’t even want to go and sit through my brother’s usual bullshit about how great he is. But I went, and as usual pretty much remained quiet. My brother asks, so when are you moving out? I was like excuse me? He says, “You’re 18 now, you need to get out on your own now.” Literally no one said anything, so I told him it’s none of his business. He says, “Well I moved out at 19.” Here’s where things spiraled. I said to him, “Your’e not even on your own yet since you haven’t bothered paying a single penny of rent in 7 years.” He was fuming and tried changing the topic. My mom made a comment about that soon changing. Brother’s girlfriend was like what? So I told her, he moved out at 19 and hasn’t paid our parents a penny of rent all these years. She was livid, unbeknownst to anyone at that table, she had been paying my brother rent for two years because he led her to believe he was paying rent. The topic went off somewhere else. Then right back to me. My brother trying to give me fatherly advice by saying I should focus on my current job and forget wasting time with college. This was absolutely unsolicited advice. It pisses me off when he does this because he always does it, and acts like because of our age gap he has SO much more knowledge than stupid ass me. He again comments about me moving out, says to our dad…”I can’t believe you haven’t kicked her out after she brought all those animals in your house.” They both laugh. I had enough, I got up from the table and yelled JUST LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE. My mom understood, but she doesn’t want the family to fight. My dad said I was extremely rude by lashing out, caused a scene, made undue stress and embarrassed everyone. Apparently after I walked out, my brother says…”Well she obviously has something wrong in her head.” I felt bad because I’m sure a few kids dining with their families heard me, and I shouldn’t have cussed in front of them. Andddd…I guess I should have held it in and dealt with it later but I’ve always let this crap slide and I was sick of it.

10vi1cx,402,"My wife was a lot younger than me and she had a ten year old son when we met.  Her ex had shared custody.  I had a couple of grown children from my first wife.  My stepson Charlie and I never really bonded.  He had a father and he made it clear I wasn't his parent just his mom's husband.  I respected this, he was always polite and respectful, just distant.  I helped pay for his university when he went and we attended his graduation.  When he got married our invitation was made out to his mother plus one.  That was kind of a slap in the face but we still attended and gave them a substantial cash gift to start their life.  The thank you card didn't have my name on it.  My first wife had passed away from.cancer and it broke me.  I didn't want to go through that again. Her youth was one thing that attracted me to my second wife. I know it was selfish.  But I liked having a beautiful young wife to take care of and she liked me well enough. I didn't realize how much I loved her until she died. She passed away from a stroke. She was 49.  Charlie came to the funeral with his family. His wife whom I had only met at the wedding and his kids. We had known he had kids but he had never made the effort to bring them for a visit.  My wife loved the kids but Charlie wouldn't make the effort to come see us.  My wife only had a very small estate and she left it all to Charlie. He also took almost everything of sentimental value that she owned before we got married.  I didn't begrudge him any of it. My first grandchild just graduated cum laude last year  and I went to his graduation. My son and his wife have worked hard to get their kids into college and I am proud of them. My son mentioned that my grandson had a job waiting and would be debt free pretty quick.  I asked how much he owed.  Then I wrote him a check to pay it off.  I plan to do this for all my grandchildren.   I guess my daughter-in-law and my stepson's wife are Facebook friends or something.  He found out what I did.  And he came around to ask if I planned to do the same for his children.  I don't really have any connections to his kids.  I don't see them. They don't consider me their grandfather. I've personally only ever seen them at the funeral.  I was really put off by him coming by to ask about money after ignoring me for years.  I know that if my wife were alive she would want me to help out her son. It just felt dirty. I said that I had money for them in my will and if they needed it for university I would give it to them early. He said I'm a petty little man and that his mom would be ashamed of me for treating his kids like this.  I don't really think I owe them anything.  They have a ""real"" grandfather.

10vojq3,269," Hi...So, long story short, I (F very early 20s) own a toy that looks like a lipstick. I was headed somewhere after work where I would need this tool, so in my purse it went. It was in a velvet pouch that was in a makeup bag that was inside a pocket that was on the inside of my zipped up, filled to the brim purse.I put the purse where purses go (pretty high area of locker-like compartments) and went about my day. Mind you, the place where we leave personal belongins is outside my working area and no personal belongings are allowed past that point. We aren't allowed to use locks per the boss' request.However, I got called to the front desk for my admin coworker wanted to return something of mine to me. When I got there, she told me that her not very old daughter had gone through my purse and found my ""lipstick"". I stood there in disbelief and expecting an apology to follow her rant as she explained how her child had gone through my purse and through different pockets and mini purses to be able to find that. She said she liked the shade and went to her mom to ask for something similar, then my coworker figured out it wasnt a lipstick once she opened it and saw no pigment and a charging port.She flipped out on me saying how I shouldn't bring that anywhere near my place of work and I stood there, flabbergasted and all I could say is ""she went through my purse? why did you let your daughter go through someone else's purse that was out of reach?"" I also told her I had not brought that anywhere near my workplace, as it was outside and tucked away. I don't think her daughter knows what it was, but it's disturbing to me that she had to find a stool to climb onto the locker area, access my purse and then go through all of it till she found it. I want to make it crystal clear how out of reach the thing was.We didn't come to any sort of agreement and kept blaming each other, so I apologized for her child having found it, as that was not my intention, and told her to keep her child out of my things or out of the personal belonging area entirely.She told my boss about it (we have a very good work environment and boss is more a coworker than a boss) and boss adviced her to keep daughter out of that room since anything legal could be in it, clarifying that legal doesn't mean daughter's age appropriate (alcohol, cigarretes, lighters...) Now my coworker is bitching about it to whoever will listen (again, don't care, pretty good work atmosphere and we are all quite friendly and close, we talk about adult matters often after hours having a drink and one of them was the one to recommend the adult toy to me haha).Coworkers are staying out of it although some of them have privately taken my side.

10vnhh8,691,"Throwaway because girlfriend is a Redditor. I (24M) am Canadian and have been in the US for 10 months, where I have been living with my American girlfriend (25F) for 7 of them. My time in the US is almost up, and I'm stressing about having to return to Canada. For one, my family is reliant on me to make money to support my grandma and pay for her medical support. I also want to earn money to give my girlfriend, she deserves the world. Because I have so many side hustles going on to earn money, I admittedly don't spend a lot of time with my girlfriend, but I've always been open with her that I am not able to give her a lot of attention right now even though I love her more than anything.My girlfriend lost her job last month, and as a result has been at the house more often. We live in a one bedroom and split the rent evenly. She understands that I'm busy all day/night, but I don't like when she's sitting in the same room as me. Even her presence is distracting to me, she will try to start conversations and she's not the cleanest, so I would ask her to go to the bedroom for the day while I worked in the living room at my desktop. She was ok with that for a few weeks, but began to complain that she was stuck in the bedroom. She says that since she's paying half the rent, she has every right to be where she wants to be in the house. I agree. So, after a few big fights, we agreed she would leave the house during the day and I would leave the house at night. Well, now she's upset that she's spending all day out of the house. Her car was in an accident last month and has been in the shop, so she's been going to do work in the boba shop by our house. Before anyone asks, I am not able to do the work I do during the day outside of the house, which is why I leave in the evening.Today, my friend was over and was sitting on the couch, where my girlfriend usually eats lunch. I say couch, but it's really an oversized loveseat. My girlfriend went to go sit in her usual spot to eat lunch, but I asked her if she could eat in the kitchen instead so she would have more room to eat. She went to the kitchen, but I could tell she was pissed. When I asked her if everything was ok, she said she was tired of me controlling her. I think she's being selfish and not considering that I need a certain environment to concentrate and get work done, and that I am doing all of this for her and my family and one day I will be able to spend all the time in the world with her, but that right now I am really grinding and most strong relationships are built on sacrifice.

10vs6f5,230,"For many years, I (24F) was friends with (24F). We met in college and became really close ... or so I thought. Savannah I were opposites in many ways. She is very beautiful blonde woman, and really sweet and outgoing. I am pretty too but also awkward and confrontational.One year ago, when I came back to our college state, she offered to come over to my apartment and help me unpack. It was then that she told me she was engaged to Eric (25F). I have always found Eric attractive, but didn't say anything. They had been dating for years, but things had just gotten real! I ignored my shattering heart and congratulated her while she showed off her ring and engagement photos. Some girls seem to have everything just handed to them, I thought. Savannah was one of them.""And you will definitely be on the guest list!"" she told me. I had never been invited to wedding before (sad, I know), and I was excited! Even three months before the wedding, I bought a beautiful wedding guest dress from Michael Kors. This was gonna be FUN!Savannah has always been lively, outgoing, and popular, and her wedding was the major event of the town. All my friends were talking about it. I always had a good fashion sense, so other girls would ask me what I plan to wear to it. We all had a sleepover at Savannah's house and watched ""Bride Wars"", and she handed me a pink invitation for the Rehearsal Dinner. She showed everyone the wedding dress she chose, and looked gorgeous in it! I had never been more envious of someone.However, within a few weeks, I knew something was off. All my other friends had gotten wedding invitations in white envelopes, but I never did. I just had the pink rehearsal dinner card (which everyone else had also gotten) but not the wedding invitation. I was confused. Why would she just invite me to the rehearsal dinner but not the wedding?Thinking it might have been an oversight, or maybe the envelope got lost in the mail, I decided to talk to Savannah about it. I was wondering if she indeed just wanted me to come to the rehearsal dinner but not the wedding.Turns out, she meant exactly that. **""If a spot opens up at my wedding, I'll let you know!""** I was really hurt, especially by the fact that she'd *told* me I'd be invited and asked me to save the date.A week before the wedding, I got a phone call. It was from Savannah. Sure enough, someone had gotten sick, and guess what? They had a spot for me now! She basically told me I am a Plan B!Because dignity is important, I declined going to both the RD and the wedding. I congratulated her and wished both her and Eric the best in their marriage.Months passed, and I hadn't heard from Savannah at all.

We drifted apart because she doesn't support my career ambitions and had a tendency to pull me to the fun and leisure lifestyle and that came in conflict with my need to focus on my goals.  I'm on a very strict budget . I’m also planning on celebrating passing my qualification exam by not working for two months this summer until I get integrated into the job offer waiting for me. After 7 years apart, she invited me to lunch with another friend of hers. I finished my post graduate, created a startup, have accomplishments that I’m proud of and she isn’t interested. We can never talk about anything but her. She insisted, and I gave in because her husband just dumped her and I thought maybe I could make a difference at least for a few hours. Her other friend, Elizabeth (f32) arrived, and we started ordering food. Elizabeth is extremely wealthy. I’ve known her since we were teenagers. Her own friendship with Liah kind of died years ago but I’ve always suspected it’s because Liah doesn’t reciprocate. One hour into our lunch date, I noticed Elizabeth’s face changed when Liah started ordering like crazy. I really wanted one of those huge crabs (like the mugbangs), so I specifically ordered one to avoid past situations where Liah suddenly wants everyone to share their food.  Because Elizabeth’s demeanor was a red flag, I asked for a separate check to send the message that I'm not an opportunist. No one flinched so it was all good. I paid for my food via cash app and whatever else I ordered was from drinks and dessert. Liah starts dragging, she ate a lot and called her family that she was carrying a doggy bag. Ok cool. But then she did a “I forgot my wallet” skit which was especially infuriating. Elizabeth looked unimpressed and said “use your cash app then”. Liah then came up with a sob story, ran her ATM and it was declined.  Elizabeth called the waitress and asked for a detailed separation of the bill items, then paid for her own food while I was perplexed and fucking speechless. Elizabeth called Liah a leech.  I was so embarrassed I went out of the restaurant and called Uber. I feel horrible because I walked out and hid from her the whole time while waiting for my ride. I don’t know what happened next.

My bf has met my other cousins but not him so he asked if he could join us and hangout and I said for sure. Akash and I were just catching up while everyone was on their way. During the conversation a lot of our childhood stories came up and I got sentimental. We were also bonding over some of the childhood trauma we experienced and how it affected us. I started sobbing as I was telling him how much I missed our group and I'm so happy we are all gonna be together after a long time. He consoled me and patted my head saying how proud he is of me that his little sister is now such a responsible grownup and stuff. My bf walked into the living room at that moment and saw me leaning my head on his shoulder and crying. He blurted out ""ayo what in the alabama shit is going on"" and started laughing hysterically. My face turned red in embarrassment and I could barely mumble ""what"". Akash stood up and firmly said ""excuse me? do we have a problem here?"" and asked me if this is my bf. Then I asked bf what's wrong with you? who starts a conversation like that? He got even more defensive and said ""dont desi people marry their cousins all the time? It's funny bc it's true."" Well I didn't find it funny and was enraging with embarrassment so I asked him to leave immediately before others get here. He tried to argue and say hi to Akash but I didn't leave any space for explanation and held the door open until he got out. I turned my phone off when he started blasting my phone with texts demanding to speak. My other cousins arrived shortly and we all had a great time catching up. When I woke up in the morning and turned my phone on I saw tons of missed calls and texts from my bf. He even posted some passive aggressive stuff on social media without mentioning my name. He said how I overreacted to a very simple joke and turned him into the bad guy and I said if your first thought is to make such a cheap disgusting joke in front of someone who you literally saw for the first time then you really need to work on your humor and hung up. I'm still very upset and embarrassed and asked Akash to not tell anyone about it yet.

I immediately said no, and they are all upset at me. My wife told me I should think it over (she is the eldest sibling by 8 years so I think she feel’s responsibility).

She's been complaining about not having her own space and her sister annoying her. The psychs solution was that she gets my room and I share with my 12 year old. I certainly didn't commit to that but just let them talk it through. Get home and my 13yo starts packing up her stuff, sister asks what she's doing and she explains that her and I are swapping rooms. Needless to say the 12yo gets a bit pissed at that. I tell my eldest that we won't be swapping rooms and I won't be sharing a room with one of the kids. She now is claiming I'm the AH (not in those words) because I “promised” we would in the session with her psych, and I clearly don't care about her. I tried to talk about moving her into her brothers room and the 9yo and 12yo could share. But that was met by a lot of anger from the 12 yo who was very against sharing with her brother.

10vh24k,162," \[NSFW because boobs and cancer are mentioned\]I'll  try to keep this as short as possible. Myself and one of my closest  friends are attending a wedding in 3 weeks time. It's been in planning  since before Covid, and we wanted to make sure everybody could come  together which is why it's been postponed as long as it has. I'm going  as a guest, but my friend is one of 5 head bridesmaids. The dresses were  picked out specially and have already arrived. It's pertinent to note  that these are strapless dresses (you know, the ones held up primarily  by your boobs) and every one is fine with that. Except for my friend.2  months ago she received a diagnosis of cancer and had an emergency  double mastectomy and has been going through chemo since. She has always  been a wig wearer anyway so if you hadn't been told you wouldn't know  she had cancer and was going through treatment. Because of the wedding  and also because of her own personal feelings this isn't widely known  information, and she didn't want to inform the bride and groom because  she, in her words not mine, ""\[doesn't\] want to take attention away from  the happy couple on their big day by being the token sick one"". My views  on her telling other people about this is irrelevant, it's her body,  her condition, and ultimately it is her information to tell and I am not  in a position to disclose something so sensitive.Now  here comes the clincher... since the mastectomy once the wounds had  healed over, she bought basically a big padded bra that gives the  impression of having breasts. It's convincing, fairly neutral colour,  but with a strapless dress the top of the bra would be very obvious, and  were she not to wear the pads the dress wouldn't... yknow... have  anything to hold on to. So a bit of a double dilemma. This is where I  come in - I work with fabric a fair amount for my job and can roughly  mimic the embroidery on the dress into two small but functional straps  that would hide the arm holes of the padded bra and stay in line with  the style of the dress. I was the one who recommended this, as my friend  is adamant she doesn't want to ruin the mood of the wedding by telling  people her situation. Neither of us can decide if we should or not -  WIBTA if I sewed straps onto the dress to allow her time to reveal the  diagnosis in her own time?

10vj60b,125,"Okay, so my parents are originally from Mexico and my Dad in particular grew up in rural poverty. He's really had to work for everything he has. Growing up, he was always very insistent that if an item is in the kitchen, then it's for anyone to eat, especially him. This has caused several issues with making food for company and family, because even when a note is placed on a cake or food item that is meant to be eaten later, and for multiple people he will not care and eat it. And he will eat more than his fair share of it. Even if he's already eaten dinner, let's say, and you come over late with take-out to quickly eat, he will glare at you because he's expecting something extra from you. It seriously bothers him to watch others eat except him. It's a psychological thing brought on by poverty, I'm sure of it.So my husband and I go to a bakery for some coffee. We note they have some nice bread for breakfast. So we get a croissant and anpan roll. I tell my husband if he wants to eat his whole croissant, then buy my Dad another one to make sure he has one, or hide the one he bought for himself. I know my Mom is going to make my Dad a big breakfast. But it doesn't matter. If it's in the kitchen it's fair game, even if we label it. My husband said I was exaggerating and that he didn't need to hide his food or get another croissant just for him. Sure enough, come morning time, the croissant is already half eaten and I can see the look of utter annoyance on my husband's face.

I told my Dad he's rude, it's not an endearing quality about him, and that I was absolutely right food should either be hidden from him or another one should be purchased even though his huge breakfast was ready for him and we can't have something without him having it as well.

10vukad,43,"I have 2 daughters in college, Olivia (20) and Sophia (18). Sophia has a learning disability and the school's disability center gave her a smart pen that records the lectures while she writes notes, so that if she misses anything she can go back and listen. The pen is only compatible with a very specific, very expensive (for a notebook) notebook. When Sophia got the pen, she let us play with it. We recorded ourselves talking or singing while writing or drawing. Olivia chose to write a few curse words and record herself saying them. Sophia told her not to do it again and took the pen and notebook to her room. Well, she got sick a couple weeks after and had to miss a class. Olivia is in the same class so Sophia gave Olivia the pen and notebook and told her to record the class so she could listen to it later. Olivia chose not to record the class. She decided it would be funny to write curse words/curse Sophia out on the first line of every page and record herself saying/singing the words. Sophia is very embarrassed and refuses to use the notebook. She was able to get the disability center to wipe the recordings from the pen but they refused to replace the notebook because it was still usable.When Sophia told me what happened and that the disability center wouldn't give her a new book, I gave Olivia an ultimatum. Either she buys Sophia a new book or I take her car (registered in my name and under my insurance policy) and she'll have to walk to the bus stop 2 miles away and take the bus to school (which their friends say takes an hour, compared to the 15 minute drive). We got on Amazon and the only thing we found that was compatible with Sophia's pen was a set of 4 books for $40. Olivia said she's not going to pay that much but I told her it was either that or the bus so she bought the books. Olivia thinks I'm being unfair and my husband is starting to agree with her but I think it's Olivia's responsibility to replace the book and if the only thing that's available is a 4 pack for $40, well that sucks and hopefully she won't do it again.

Apparently my friend spoke to the manager on duty, and he spoke to the offending party, and I was told they wouldn't bother me anymore. I did tell him that I found that unsatisfactory (personally I think they should have been asked to leave), but that I understood that they didn't want to create a scene.

He doesn’t have contact with anyone from high school. Geoffrey thinks that if a person has contact with anyone from their high school (even past teachers,) it means they peaked in high school. He constantly makes assumptions about people (often strangers) based on his own high school experiences. The comments he makes are mean-spirited and uncalled for.An example is how we were visiting a relative who lives next to a park and there was a random teenager using the fitness equipment. Without any prompting, Geoffrey loudly said “Better live up those quarterback days now. You’ll be working at a gas station after graduation.” Whenever we go out, Geoffrey makes rude comments about the employees and assumptions about their time in high school. We recently had a very sweet waitress at a restaurant, and Geoffrey felt the need to say “Bet she was prom queen once, now she’s fat. Probably raising five kids alone.” As I said, his comments are just mean and uncalled for.Recently, we were at my parents’ house for their anniversary. My daughter Emma was in the living room doing an online dance challenge. Geoffrey made a comment about how Emma should have “grown out of” doing online dance challenges and “be careful, she’ll wind up being her school’s version of Kathy” who was a girl that I and Geoffrey knew in high school. Kathy was always nice to Geoffrey. Geoffrey had gotten angry and refused to talk to her after she went to prom with another boy instead of him.I reminded Geoffrey that Emma’s thirteen and to just leave them be. Geoffrey again told me to “be careful” or else “she’ll end up being that fat single mom who always talks about her cheerleader days.” In the past, I have just told Geoffrey not to be rude, but roping my daughter into his comments was when I had enough.I pulled Geoffrey aside to a more private area and told him that he needs to get over high school. I know it wasn’t a great time for you and I’m sorry. But you need to stop taking that out on other people. Start seeing a therapist again and do whatever you need to move on. Otherwise, you’re going to end up alone if you keep lashing out at others this way.Geoffrey told the rest of the family about what I said. I shared my side of the story but several others told me that Geoffrey was “just concerned” for his niece’s future after graduation and telling him to “get over high school” dismissed/invalidated his experience. And not having close friends during developmental years can affect someone for their whole life.Geoffrey’s experiences are valid, which is why I told him about returning to therapy so he can work on properly dealing with them. And Geoffrey’s experiences do not give him the right to make such mean-spirited comments about others.

She was one of my bridesmaids but she made everyone else feel extremely uncomfortable. She refused to come to my bridesmaids events (only came when the groomsmen came too), left 20 minutes into my bachelorette party to go to a club without saying goodbye, was very mean to my other bridesmaids and sisters, and didn't even want to get ready with the bridesmaids morning of the wedding. She called my mother (who doesn't speak Spanish) nasty names in Spanish to her face, and she had AirPods in 24/7 and actively ignored everyone who talked to her.My whole family left after the wedding and she hadn't spoken more than one sentence to my family. I called her out and she broke down explaining how she felt like my family had stolen my husband from her family and was jealous. I told her that was no excuse to treat my family the way she did. (I have a list of every little thing she did on my phone that was rude the whole week.... the list is 134 times long and we barely saw her.) I told her I appreciate her apology. She took that as being forgiven and treats me like a friend now.Fast forward back to now and she's really upset I refused to be one of her bridesmaids.

10vrxnl,40,"Hey Reddit, I'm hoping to get some outside perspective on a situation that happened at a family gathering with my 10-year-old son, who's adopted, and my husband and his family.So, I'm a proud mother of a 10-year-old boy who is very smart and mature for his age. He's always been aware of his adoption as my husband and I have never hidden it from him, but we've also never made a big deal out of it either. He's just a regular kid and we love him just as much as we would any biological child.Yesterday, we were all at my husband's parents' house for a family gathering. The situation started when my 4 year old niece innocently asked why my son's skin was a different color than everyone else's, not knowing about his adoption. Before I could even respond, one of the grandparents said, ""That's because he's from a different planet!"". Fortunately, no one laughed. However, my son turned red and looked down, seemingly upset and embarrassed, and didn't say anything.I immediately stood up for my son and told the grandparents that they were being disrespectful, but they just laughed it off and continued making jokes about his adoption to my son's cousins. My husband also stood up for our son and told them to stop, but the grandparents just ignored us and said we were being sensitive.The situation just escalated and it became clear that the grandparents had no intention of stopping. I didn't want my son to feel any more uncomfortable or embarrassed. This was not the first time that his step-grandparents had made these kinds of jokes about him. It was becoming a regular occurrence at family gatherings, and my son was getting increasingly upset each time. I felt like I needed to step in and put a stop to it, so I decided to take him and leave the gathering.My son was quiet on the way home, but when I asked him how he was feeling, he simply replied, ""I'm adopted."" This broke my heart and I could tell he was hurt by the whole situation, and I feel terrible that I hadn’t done anything until yesterday.I'm now considering never meeting the grandparents again because, as I said before, this has happened more than once, and I don't want my son to continue to be the target of their jokes.My husband was not happy with my decision to leave and thought it was going too far. He complained that I was overreacting and that I should have stayed and dealt with his parents. He told me that it was his family and that I needed to be more understanding.Was I the asshole?UPDATE!: I just had a heart-to-heart conversation with my son and I'm left completely shocked by his confession. Apparently, they say even worse things (I will not give details) when my husband and I are not around and my son had never said anything because he didn't want to cause problems and upset anyone. I am absolutely appalled by what I have learned and after our discussion I have made the decision to NEVER visit my husband's parents again, as I will not subject my son to any further emotional harm. This is straight up abuse and I am even considering suing them. I will definitely have a talk with my husband.",AITA for standing up for my son and causing a scene at the family gathering?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vrxnl/aita_for_standing_up_for_my_son_and_causing_a/
10vr330,86,"My (43F) husband (41M) and I are in the thick of it with three kids (6, 4, 6mo), 2 dogs (that I wanted), and an assortment of lizards, snakes, fish, etc that are his pets.When he agreed we could get a dog it was with the caveat that I would pick up after the dog(s). Which I have done for the 3+ years we have had them (even when 9 months pregnant in the summer).Tonight, I came home from an urgent care appointment for myself around the time when my kids would normally all be going to bed. I needed to nurse the baby and put him down, and help my husband put the 6 and 4 down as well (because he skips things like teeth brushing, books, and pajamas if I don't).I'm obviously not feeling well (sinus infection), and walked in to find that one of the dogs clearly had a stomach issue sometime during the day. There was poop on the floor of the nursery and on the floor of the room the big kids share.The baby was crying because he was hungry. Bedtime needed to be started. The kids cannot go to sleep in rooms with poop in them.His solution was to just have everyone sleep in our room until I could get to the poop cleanup, because he absolutely was not doing it.I pretty much begged, saying that I'm sick and I need to feed the baby and that's something he can't do, and can't he just help me out this once?He refused, saying it makes him sick, and he didn't want the dogs in the first place because he was done cleaning up after pets.I ended up putting the baby down and letting him fuss while I picked up poop, flushed it, and wiped the carpets in a cursory clean-up before nursing the baby and putting everyone to bed an hour later than normal.Was I wrong to ask for help even though he did explicitly say he wasn't cleaning up after the dogs? Or is this something a good partner would have done without throwing some 3 year old agreement in my face when our lives have changed significantly (a third baby) since it was made?EDITING TO ADD: I love my dogs. I work from home and take care of them all day, letting them in and out, giving good boy/girl treats, going for walks, picking up after them, getting them to their annual appointments, grooming appointments, dosing heartworm and flea medicine timely, and giving them pets/snuggles quite regularly.

10vq5jp,26,"So for some background I (about to turn 18 nonbinary) don't currently live with either of my parents. However I am supposed to be at my mom's house every other weekend. To explain a bit, one of my moms exes (X) reported to CPS that my mom and her boyfriend (MB) were violating his parole again. MB isn't supposed to be around kids due to an incident that happened years ago. From what I know he was in a bar and took a girl home that he didn't realize was underage. My mom and him have been caught not following his no kids allowed rule before. However he didn't get in trouble beyond a slap on the wrist.On to the current issue. Just before Christmas I was told that my mom had lost all custody of my sibling and me temporarily due to an issue with MB. At the time I thought that more drama was just being stirred up by X as he had pulled shit before on my Mom like calling the cops when it was her weekend and random CPS calls, tho those stopped a while ago.C (my guardian) and my Dad weren't allowed to tell me much. But they could tell me that the report had something to do with MB. I was confused because my mom had gone and taken the classes and such to become a community support person for MB after the last incident. So Just a misunderstanding right?Wrong. I got to see the list of rules my mom signed when she became a community support person. They had broken at least half of them. Which ones I won't get I to cause word limit. So, when the social worker came to my school to talk to me, I didn't lie. In fact I gave more information then she asked.Well, what I told the social worker was brought up in the emergency hearing. It is safe to say my mom is pissed. Other than today, I haven't talked to her since Christmas Eve. When she was allowed to come to my dad to see me and my siblings for Christmas.I reached out to her today though. Part of it was to get her to transfer my money from the savings account she opened for me into my debit account so I can start managing my own money. But I also asked if we could find a time for me and her to talk. She said we could, but it'd be hard. She's doing a bunch of interviews for a second job, and doesn't have much free time.I feel like I might be an asshole cause from what I know a large part of her need for a second job is because of MB going back to jail so there's only her income.

10vtnsw,50,"Our hot water line started leaking late Friday night. I (29F) worked all weekend. My husband was home with our 2 year old while I was working. He worked on calling companies to come out and quote us to fix everything. Two companies showed up today, one quoted an 8K fix and could do it the next day, the other was 4K but can't get to it until Friday. The location of the leak was in a joint of the outgoing hot water pipe off of the water heater. The two heaters we have, aren't actually broken but are 15 years old and showing signs of wear and tear. My husband wants to replace everything so we decided we will be getting a tankless water heater. This entire time, I felt like all we needed to do was fix the outgoing pipe but was fine replacing everything so no further issues down the line.Today, 3rd day without hot water, I asked again if we could at least just fix the pipe so we could have hot water while waiting for Friday. My husband flipped. He said I was being privileged, entitled and impatient and how ridiculous I am that I can't wait until Friday. I was sick of it so I drove to home depot, asked a worker, got the proper parts and repaired the pipe in less than an hour including my time at home depot. Everything if functioning well, no leaks and lovely hot water flowing. I even put a water alarm next to the water heaters just in case.For context, within the last month, our basement flooded due to a storm, had a solar issue, had an outdoor gas leak, we have a 3k repair for his truck needed and will have to pay 5k in taxes.

10vtfmg,62,"My (25m) fiancé (24f) are new parents to our baby boy as of 7 months ago. The pregnancy was unplanned but we were happy to keep the baby as I make good money in a stable career as an engineer. Everything has been going wonderfully so far, besides of course the normal new parent/baby difficulties, until this week when my fiancé told me it would be best if I got rid of my current car and bought a new SUV (she means NEW from the dealership, she doesn't believe in used cars for whatever reason). Her reasoning is that is unsafe to put a baby car seat in a 2 door car, despite the fact that the baby has only been in my car twice, riding in my fiancés suv the vast majority of the time.I told her that I didn’t think it was unsafe but that I’d do some research and that if it is that we could explore solutions. I looked into it that night, and according to every source I could find it seems that it is perfectly safe to have a car seat in the back seats of a 2 door car as long as it fits properly (which our car seats does). I told her that there was no need to worry as it should be perfectly safe. She interrupted and demanded that I should just grow up and make the right decision. She said that as a father my priority should be my son and not my “sports car”, to which I responded that he is my priority but that these things don’t conflict. She won’t budge.I explained to her that a new base level SUV costs about double what I could sell my car for (her car was gifted to her by her parents and is worth about three times what mine is). I snapped and accused her of using our son as an excuse to force me to get rid of my car. I’ll spare the worst details but safe to say she was the most angry I have ever seen her. I apologized for for accusing her but added that she was being irrational and had no logical basis for why I couldn’t keep the car. This did not help and no she has gone to sleep without speaking to me for the past few hours. Am I the asshole?For more context: I drive a 2012 BMW 335i that I bought when I was 22, a few months after landing my first engineering gig after college. I wouldn’t say it’s a sports car exactly, its sporty, but it’s not particularly fast or small and is about as practical as a two door car can get. I ADORE this car, I do almost all of the maintenance myself along with some minor mods I did to make the car exactly how I wanted. The only wrenching I have done on this car since he was born was changing the oil which she threw a fit over because I was “avoiding my parenting duties” and just could not seem to understand that changing the oil is EXTREMELY CRUCIAL to keeping it running as reliably as possible.My fiancé has always hated my car. She would make comments about it being a “toy” and complain about how small it is, also saying that it makes me look like a douchebag. She always got upset when I would take a few hours out of my weekend to install a new part or to fix or replace something.

I then asked her to show me the note, but again she refused. I was getting annoyed and angrier, so I went up to her and yanked the paper from her hands.

These tags cost $76 for the weekend and came with signs saying ""No Parking by Order of Madison Police"" and listed the hours that I had purchased the spots for.We spent all day with the UHaul parked in those spots while we unloaded the truck. We then drove the UHaul (it is a 10-footer) to go have dinner at a local restaurant. When we came back, there were two cars parked in the spaces - even though the signs on the meters clearly stating ""No Parking"" were still there. It was a Saturday night in downtown Madison and every spot on the street was taken.So I called the police (non-emergency) line and told them someone was illegally parking in the spots that I had paid for and that I had nowhere to park our truck and I wanted the vehicles towed.30 minutes later, the parking authority cops and a tow truck arrived, I showed them my proof that I had the meters reserved for the weekend, and they proceeded to start to load the first vehicle on the truck.Here's where I feel like a little bit of TA. I didn't notice that one of the cars had a handicap placard on its rearview mirror. As they had just finished loading up that vehicle on the tow truck, a man with his son (who appeared to be mentally disabled) came running out of a nearby restaurant yelling that it was their car. The tow truck guy said, ""Don't talk to me, talk to him"" and pointed at me.I told the man, ""I'm sorry your car is being towed, but you parked here illegally and I paid for these meters so I could park my truck here all weekend. The signs are clearly visible, you had no right to park here and there's no place else on this street to park the truck.""He proceeded to call me every name in the book, and said ""My son is handicapped! I can park wherever I want! Why would you pick on a handicapped person! This is going to cost me hundreds!""The parking cop stepped in, on my behalf, and said ""Sir, your handicapped placard does not give you the right to park in a NO PARKING spot."" And then told the guy where he could pick up his vehicle (at this point, the tow truck had begun driving away).The guy yelled at me some more and said ""I hope you're happy, AH!""I felt bad for the guy... I'm sure it cost at least $300 to get his car back... but then again, I don't think I did anything wrong. I paid for the spot - and handicapped passenger or not, he had no legal right to take it.Was I TA?",AITA for having a car towed?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vukzw/aita_for_having_a_car_towed/
10viuye,56,"To give some context, I (m31) own a few car dealerships and I have an employee (f26) who is great at selling cars but, as a person, she has made some awful awful life decisions.To give a few examples, she is an ex-felon, she gave up her child to foster care, and she has a very...unique relationship with her current-ex. I know this because he came to my dealership and cussed her out in-front of the whole showroom. I had to eventually have him thrown out and she promised to me that this wouldn't happen again.With this in mind, one day I got my little brother (m24) a job as an intern at one of my showrooms (he's a business management major and wants to eventually get into the business). He's a hard worker, great grades, and is basically the embodiment of black-excellence.Nevertheless, in the first few weeks of interning for one of my managers, I realized that he had gotten very very close with her. Then a manager of mine made it aware to me that they have started dating and that he wanted to inform me before having to inform HR (as that may lead to them being reprimanded).This whole situation has thrown me for a loop. I love my brother but this is not right. For 1, he hasn't disclosed this to HR, which is an ethical problem (as he is an intern and she is an employee). For 2, this just feels like watching a crash waiting to happen. Like I know he didn't know her past and he's got love-goggles on.With all this in mind, as their employer, I did tell him to report this to HR. During this conversation, I also asked him if he was sure he really wanted to date her. He said, yes, and I told him what I knew about her so he could make an informed decision. Now let me be clear, I did not at any point tell him that she was an ex-felon (that would be unethical). I did however tell him things what I directly witnessed or was made aware to me (and basically the entire showroom) due to situations like the one mentioned above. If it was told to me directly by her, in confidence, I did not say it. The things revealed on the showroom that day included things like adultery and etc. He clearly didn't know all of this but my wife has stated that I had no right to say anything beyond referring them to HR. I said, I just wanted him to make an informed decision.With all this in mind, AITA?&amp;#x200B;EDIT (Clarification):1. I thought a personal approach would be the best one to take here. She is on thin ice with HR. If I did report her, it may have resulted in an ethics investigation and, given her record as an ex-felon, that could have possibly eliminated her future job prospects. I did not believe her personal-life should effect whether she gets a job (given how great at this job she is).  So I did not report this to HR, and instead went to him directly first and then her as well.2. There seems to be some confusion from direct messages I have received. There is a difference between telling HR about a relationship and telling HR about a code violation. I told them to tell HR about their relationship. I could have reported them for a code violation, I didn't, due to the aforementioned reasons.3. I also feared other employees telling him, which would have been even more disastrous. I don't know how long she was willing to risk it, but that could have led to some uncomfortable conversations, not to mention another incident at the showroom.4. One other thing, I believe I should mention is that the incidences are years apart. The incidence with her ex-boyfriend happened some 3 years ago and them being boyfriend-girlfriend has been something that at most probably has been going on for a few months.",AITA for telling my brother to stay away from an employee of mine?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10viuye/aita_for_telling_my_brother_to_stay_away_from_an/
10vtaj6,68,"I apologize for how long this was but the details are important(?) TLDR: My ex-wife demands I provide more child support due to her moving to a much more expensive location and I said no.My ex and I divorced in 2015, we had four kids together. I was active military and she was a stay at home mom. It made sense for the kids to stay with her, I was subject to fairly often work trips. Our state (WA) has a formula to determine child support and I offered to pay more than the state required ($1500).A few months later, I met my girlfriend on eHarmony (we married in 2017). Things went ok for the next year or so, but as always happens in the military, I was transferred to a different state. This required a change in the parenting plan, we mutually agreed (without going to court to officially change it).This seemed to work out ok. In early 2018, she (my ex) let me know she was struggling financially and was having a difficult time finding a job while having the kids full-time. I agreed to take them for the ’18-’19 school year, so she could work full-time on finding a good job. Also during this time, I continued to pay her half the amount of my child support ($750) so she could continue to keep the house. It was not easy, but I never asked her for any money during this time.Fast forward to 2020, I have retired from the military and moved back to the area to be close to the kids. Note that my ex gets a portion (27%) of that retirement for the rest of her life (which I believe she’s entitled to).From 2020-2022, things seem pretty good. I live 20 minutes away and often visit her house to help watch the kids for work or medical reasons.She lived in a roughish area, and decided to get a job in a city 40 minutes away and made the decision to move closer to her job. After the move, she emails me demanding that I pay her more in child support due to the increased mortgage. She was super condescending and demanding. I told her no, saying her decision to move to more expensive area was her decision and I was not financially responsible for that decision. She reacted by saying I was never allowed in her house ever again and that she “didn’t need me and never did.” And we’ve lived in this detente for the next year.Fast forward again to this month, and I get another email (also during my weekend with the kids). Saying she has to replace the roof of her house; which will cost $16k which she will have to finance. She requested (not demanded this time) that I increase my financial support. The email was filled with guilt trips and never acknowledges the way I’ve supported her in the past. She proceeded to give a break down of her finances. She believes I should be responsible for 40% of her mortgage, car payments, and groceries. Her mortgage is $2500/mo and one of her car payments (lease) is $540/mo!Am I the asshole for telling her I’m not responsible for her poor financial decisions? Should I offer to take on the kids full-time?Edit 1: WA state changed its CS laws in 2017(?) which if I put in the numbers correctly (not knowing her income) I think I'd owe 1700/mo. But based on her emails, she feels that wouldn't be enough.",AITA for saying no to my ex’s request for increased child support?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vtaj6/aita_for_saying_no_to_my_exs_request_for/

English is not my first language. For context, our Wi-Fi speed is 80mpbs. There are 5 devices already connected. 3 phones and 2 Smart TVs. In the evening, the internet is a bit slower because everyone is using their phones. This girl asked me last last week to connect her to our Wi-Fi. She said she needed to do an assignment, and currently, their internet is not working. This was the first time she asked me. As a fellow student, I understand what she meant. That's why I didn't hesitate to connect her phone. She said she'll remove it (her connection or the password, I guess?) in the morning. It was fine until three days later, she was still connected. My sister said to change the password, and I did. I didn't know how to block someone's device yet. That's why I just changed the password. Then last week, she messaged me again, for the same reason that their Wi-Fi is still not fixed. So I did without hesitation because it sounded like she needed to do something urgently. After typing the password to her phone, she said the same thing. She would remove the Wi-Fi or something the next morning. Then later that day, I saw four more devices (not including our 5 devices) connected to our Wi-Fi. I was confused. Then I looked into who's device is connected and stuff. Then it was her brother and her brother's friends. Her brother from before scanned the Wi-Fi from our cousin that he's close with. So he was connected to the Wi-Fi. We changed the password from that time because he would have his friends scan too. I don't want to assume that she had them scan or something the Wi-Fi QR Code(?), but it's her brother. I don't know where he would get it because my cousin that he's close with is not here anymore. My sister was pissed because the Wi-Fi was very slow, and I explained it to her. She then changed the Wi-Fi password. It's back to just 5 devices. After this incident, I learned to block devices. Then last night, she (our neighbor) asked me again to connect her phone to our Wi-Fi. I was hesitant because my sister said not to entertain her.

10vnvti,18,"I am currently a high school senior. My friend group has about five people in it, one of them was Mia. In sophomore year, Mia got a boyfriend, Elias. Things were normal for about two months, then Mia started to only spend time with Elias. We would make plans together, Mia would say she was coming, not show up, and we would all wait for her and text her. Mia would never respond back, so we would get worried that something bad happened to her. But then when we saw her in person and asked her about it, Mia would just be like “Oh yeah, Elias and me just wanted one-on-one time.” Mia had access to her phone the whole time. She just didn’t even bother telling us and just knowingly left us waiting on her. She even lied that she had a family emergency and couldn’t come to our friend Tessa’s birthday. We bumped into Mia and Elias at the mall and found out that the family emergency was made up. (Elias was welcome to come to all these events, he and Mia just wanted couple’s only time.) That went on for almost two years. Mia barely gave us one-word answers over text and would just blow us off in person for Elias. We still tried to invite her and Elias to hang out/events, but we wouldn’t wait after five minutes because we knew that they wouldn’t show up anyway.Mia suddenly started texting us back and trying to talk to us again. It turns out Elias moved away. Mia expects us to come to lunch everyday because she says she feels too weird/bored being by herself, when we literally just can’t because we have clubs and things for college/graduation that have to get done. I’m the only person in my friend group without an actual part-time job, but it’s only because I have to babysit my siblings on weekends. Mia will tell us about plans the hour before they’re supposed to happen and will get angry that we’re too busy to hang out. Recently Mia called us all uncaring and bad friends because we were all at work/babysitting and couldn’t go to the mall.I texted Mia privately saying that she can’t expect is to drop everything for her after she’s neglected us as a friend for so long. She’s allowed to spend time with her boyfriend. But that friends are also people who you need to spend time with if you want to have a relationship with them. We can’t drop everything on your whim when you’ve barely talked to us for almost two years.My older sister Kennedy saw me texting this to Mia (she’s home from college) and said I was the asshole. Kennedy said my other friends and I were entitled and that the world doesn’t revolve around us so we can’t always expect Mia’s time. We’ve never “always expected” Mia’s time though. Just for her to not blow us off or at least be honest for two years. It also seems hypocritical because Mia chose to ignore us for so long for Elias and we literally just don’t have time to meet because of jobs and graduation/college things that need to be done. But Kennedy is usually right about things like this, so I thought I’d ask on here.",AITA For being honest with my friend that she can’t expect us to drop everything for her after she’s neglected us for so long?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vnvti/aita_for_being_honest_with_my_friend_that_she/
10vwl2w,13,"So, I’m going to start that I’ve already posted that story in other subs and got a lot of creepy messages asking for pics, so… please, don’t be creepy.I’m a 25 year old guy and my mom is 47. My father and her have been divorced for 6 years by now. They met in college and all. My father has his own life and we don’t talk much, but I live close to my mom (separately, though) and drop by a lot. I’ve advised her to hit the gym last year and she did. Two days ago, when I was at her place, she told me that she met a ‘younger’ guy there. I assumed it was someone in his early 40s or something, no big deal. But then she told me it was a 22 year old guy. Showed me their pics and all. As she said, they’ve been going out for almost a month (that explains her recent shopping spree, I guess). Then, later on in the day, when I entered the room she was on the phone with her female best friend. Regretfully, I have overheard certain details about this man she was gushing over. I don’t want to quote it, but let’s just say that mom was excited about a certain physical feature. When she noticed me, she gave me a weird look and went to the other side of the room.We didn’t talk much about it. On Monday I’ve called her a few times in the evening and she didn’t respond. She called me back this morning (Tuesday) just a few hours ago. I told her that I’ve overheard everything and asked if she was sure about what she was doing. She said it was natural and that she has certain needs, and at the end of the day we had a pretty big argument over it. I said a few things I ain’t proud of, she said she wants my support and I refused. Said he could be taking advantage of her (mom is well off), she laughed it off and I claimed she was just being stupid. At this point, she said some things in return and hung up.Funnily enough, I myself have dated older, so for me it’s sort of a boomerang.TL;DR I don’t support mom dating younger, had an argument over it.",AITA For Arguing With Mom About Her Dating Life,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vwl2w/aita_for_arguing_with_mom_about_her_dating_life/
10vtokf,17,"I, 22F live with one roommate 21F in a small apartment. We were friends before becoming roommates and we were always at each others houses anyways, so it seemed to make sense to be roommates. Everything was going so well until about three months into the lease she started dating her boyfriend, 24M. At the beginning I was so happy that she was happy after getting out of a terrible relationship before this one, but then it began to make my living situation hell.Her boyfriend is a former drug addict that has not been able to hold a job for longer than 3 weeks over the course of their relationship, so she's constantly giving him money which meant that I've had to cover her rent multiple times. He has stolen food from me, and they ransacked my room one time when they were convinced I stole something. (spoiler: I didn't.) They leave dirty dishes for weeks and food everywhere - we even had bugs for a little bit because of it. He's also very rude to me - he called me fat to my face, and said that no one would ever love me. Both times she made me apologize to him for making him mad enough to say that.In addition, he manipulates her by constantly telling her he's going to k\*\*l himself and how he's going to do it in graphic detail whenever he's upset with her, making her leave work and ditch plans with me and our other friends. He has currently been here for 15 days. Our lease says that we cannot have a guest over for more than 7 days in a row. They've kept me up every night until 4 am even after I've asked them to be quiet, and they leave messes everywhere. Every time I ask when he is going home, she or he yells at me for being insensitive towards her falling in love and that he's in a fragile mental state. I try to explain that my space just feels violated and I just want them to cut back on how many days he's here.I've talked to them many times, and I didn't want it to come to this, but I feel as though I have to go to my landlord. She's one of my closest friends (I know, I know that I should not have moved in with my best friend) but I don't even feel comfortable living here anymore.

10vr6ji,14,"My sister has lived with me and my husband more-on-than-off for 10 years, beginning with sleeping on our couch for free in a 600 sq/ft apartment downtown Vancouver, to her own bedroom/bath in a shared 2B condo for $300, to now a separate 2B basement suite in Squamish, originally for $900, recently increased to $1200. For anyone who knows this area and the housing market, these rates are incredibly low, we could easily earn double for the suite. But we've always accommodated her because she is close family who struggles financially and we hoped by leaning on us she would eventually get a leg-up on life.Fast forward: my husband and I purchased a 5B house with 3B on top, and seperate 2B downstairs. We now have 2 kids who share a room, while the 3rd room is a home daycare for 2 additional kids. So at max capacity we are 2 adults and 4 children (and a cat!) sharing the same square footage as my single sister who refuses to get a roommate to pay us more rent.A few months ago I asked what her life plans were and implied it was getting a bit cramped upstairs and ideally I would like to move the daycare downstairs so our own children can get their individual rooms back and my husband and I can separate our home from my job. Every time I bring up the subject and stress the reasons it is important for us to take over the space downstairs, she responds with ""it is too expensive for me to move out.""

I’d say we were best friends basically. She got into a relationship a few years ago and we have since drifted apart (which is to be expected when you get into a relationship). She has taken this to the extreme though - she won’t make plans with me unless it involves her boyfriend too OR if I’m driving the 45 minutes to the dive bar near them. She will never meet me for dinner or anything. I stopped driving out towards her for this reason. I felt the friendship was kind of one sided.

My name is the only name on my lease because I moved in first before my fiance and our roommate moved in later as well. I (21 F) and my fiance (20 M) have both been having issues with our roommate (22 M) since he started dating my childhood friend (22 F). Now I will say that I have known our roommate (I'll call him J) since middle school and his gf (I'll call her B) since elementary, so I feel like I have known them long enough to let them into my home. Now this is where the problem started. B started using all of my things without my permission and J has been telling me to get over myself and justifying her behavior because of her mental health issues (I know she has issues with depression). The problem is I found out that when I was 8 weeks pregnant that I have Lukimia and could no longer work so even though I'd want them out just over that I can't afford to kick them out because my fiance's income isn't enough. I've asked her to stop using my soaps and my clothes without my permission for months and the only way I could get her to stop using my soap was to get rid of it which sucked for me because I have severe allergies to most soaps so for over a month now I have not been able to properly bathe myself just to get her out of my things. When I moved all my soaps out of my bathroom to try and hide it, she raided my room and both her and my roommate said that I was being an asshole for trying to keep her out of my things. This months water bill came in too and it's over $60 because she has been taking 3 hour long showers and when I told B and J off about it they said it wasn't their problem. J made B pay the excessive bill because I told him that if she didn't cover what she used that I was going to make them pack their bags, which honestly make me feel like a jerk.

The other girl was like ""Oh, so you're capable of talking? I'd thought you were deaf.""And then it proceeded with them asking me to mind my own business, that I should just get to bed with a bottle of milk, etc. I just pretended as if it were friendly banter (I responded to their messages at times, and just laughed when they ""joked"" about me being a transwoman/feminine in nature) before eventually not responding to their messages.It's left a rather sour taste in my mouth, however, and I was just wondering whether I should've interfered in the first place.

Naturally, to initiate a conversation, my husband decided to ask my son about school, causing my son to smile awkwardly and look down, not saying anything. He was obviously uncomfortable so I glared at my husband and said it wasn’t important. We just talked about something else after that, but I couldn’t help but notice my son looking like he was about to cry. However, I never said anything because I knew he wouldn’t like it if I asked him stuff like “Are you okay?” at that time, as everyone’s attention would be on him then.After everyone left, my son came to me noticeably upset. Teary, he told me that he felt uncomfortable and embarrassed in front of everyone and that he didn’t like it (he never specified what ‘it’ was but I’m sure you understand), so I told him I’d talk to his father.Later that night, I scolded my husband for making our son feel that way, especially knowing about his disorder, and told him to apologize to him the next day. He told me he was just trying to help him, that I was overreacting and that it wasn’t a big deal, which made me mad, and we got into a fight, with me calling him an 'asshole'.

Recently my gf asked if she would be able to look through my phone. I asked her why and pointed out the previous conversation. She said she thinks I've been acting differently and she wants to make sure that I'm not hiding anything.

I told my gf we could talk about how she thinks I've been acting differently but that I don't want to let her look through my phone. She accused me of hiding something and asked why I wouldn't do this for her.

She's a very close friend and has known me since childhood and I was happy to be her bridesmaid. She had also chosen one of her work colleagues to be the maid of honor. Problems started to arise when the bride took us to go pick out the dresses. She wanted orange and purple dresses that cost about 250 dollars. The dress was very ugly and I tried to talk her into changing the dress colors but she believed it matched the theme of the wedding which, it did not. She had her heart set on it so I tried to let it go, but I couldn't. All the bridesmaids for the wedding and the maid of honor were planning a surprise for the bride, so we had created a group chat for it without the bride of course. I brought up my problem with the dress-up in the group chat and it was received well by most. Many of the women said they didn't like the dress choice but it made the bride happy so they didn't want to say anything. The maid of honor however was angry that I was trying to talk about this behind the bride's back and when I suggested bringing the dress problem up to the bride, She said I should back off. We were going to buy the dresses in 2 days and I surely am not wearing that so I brought this up to the bride and she wasn't happy, She asked me to just wear it for her special day, but I'm not spending over 250 dollars on a repulsive dress I might as well wear once and then throw away.

From asking her how her da went, to consoling her when my brother and her hit a bump or any other issues for that matter. I have never once disrespected her and even thought of her as another addition to the family.Now a few months after I meet her, I hear from my little sister that GF is saying some things behind my back. For starters, my sister was complaining about our room, it was a mess because I had been too depressed to clean up after myself, although I still tried, I acknowledge it wasn't nearly enough. GF then responds to this with ""I would've already kicked her out"". Regardless I stay cordial, when she comes over I say hi, and I ask her if I can server her a plate of food and treat her with overall too much hospitality that I feel she deserves. I never confronted GF because LS says ""GF told me that in private and confidence and if you tell her I won't talk to you ever again"". They have a good relationship and there's no reason for theirs to be rocky just cause ours is. The subject came up again tonight and LS suggested I forgive her, and I told her ""I'll be respect her but I won't forgive her, trying to get my only family left to kick me out is so green."" LS then tried to further push the concept and I snapped at her. I understand she meant no harm but at the moment I felt a bit antagonized, I'm not sure why but it sent a surge of rage through me. I yelled at her and she got upset at me and kicked me out of her room, put all my stuff out in the hall and blocked me on all socials. I told SM about this about 2 hours later and we had a talk and I apologized to LS and told her it was wrong for me to yell at her and LS says ""yeah I'm a kid I shouldn't have to deal with a 21 y/o's shit and I agree you could've handled it better and now you don't have a room because of it"".

10vogxj,31,"I don’t mind doing laundry. I started doing my own laundry when I was about 15 or 16 so I could have my favorite clothes ready for school. In college I did all my own laundry. After college I lived alone for many years and always did my own laundry.I’m married now and we have two kids. Obviously that means a lot of dirty clothes. The way my wife does laundry is maddening to me and I want to know if I’m being an asshole, or if my refusal makes sense.The laundry machines are in the basement and the washer and dryer are not adjacent. There’s about 15 feet between the two. Dumb, I know, but the way the basement is set up is not going to change anytime soon. In my mind, this is the proper way to do the laundry. You fill up one basket, take it down and place all of the clothes in the washer. The basket sits by the washer and waits. When the wash is done, you use the basket to transport the wet clothes to the dryer. The basket stays by the dryer and waits. When the dryer is done you bring up the dry clothes in the basket and fills and put them away. A few key points. I only fill up enough for one load per basket and the basket travels with the load. I also try to fills the clothes as soon as possible so they don’t get wrinkly.My wife does laundry differently. The method sometimes changes but it basically goes like this. She will fill up a basket with as many clothes as possible. That often means there’s too many clothes for one load. Some of the clothes go in the washer and some stay in the basket. To transfer the wash to the dryer, she just grabs handfuls and walks them over to the dryer. Takes a few trips to transfer a load. So now there’s two loads of laundry and one basket. Add others loads using the same method and you end up with no baskets downstairs to bring up the laundry.So many times I go down to get laundry and just have to walk back upstairs to find a basket. Or there are no empty baskets because all of them are half full of dirty clothes. Just tonight i went down and there’s a load in the wash, a load in the dryer, and two baskets with clothes in them but I’m not sure if they’re dirty or clean. It just makes no sense to me and is such a bad system that I have just given up.I still do laundry, but only if I start and finish it.

I am here for a bit more than 4 years, graduated (my 2nd education) and found a full-time job in the IT industry where I work now.In the beginning of our relationship it was the opposite financial situation- I was  basically surviving and having money just for the basics. He paid for food for both of us but I refused to take his money (he offered once). Then the situation changes to the opposite exactly a year ago. I graduated and finally landed a good job. I am getting a good salary, and if I would have lived alone - it would have been a good life. But for 2 people money is barely enough for the necessities and I can\`t spend on what brings me joy or pay off my debt on time.He started having serious back problems the same month I land the job. He couldn’t walk or get up properly for a while. I took care of all of the chores and finances on myself, except I am not paying rent as the unemployment office (if this is how it’s called) is paying for him, I have my own place. He has 2 kids from a previous relationship and I gave them money when he didn’t have any. After a while I started feeling exhausted as I did everything while working and as he started feeling better, his mood somehow got only worse. We started arguing much more frequently and I noticed he started drinking alcohol quite often. He is using some… drug substances as well. I am against it but he has to make this decision by himself. The fact is that after he gets home drunk after drinking with his buddies at the kiosk nearby (almost daily lately), we almost always get into an argument, is rude to me and apologizes the next day. We were juggling back and forth- he was stepping one step forward and two back. I also told him that I will not be able to support him soon as I go into minus. I tried to set boundaries, not always successfuly but tried to be more consistent lately. Conflicts between us worsened since then.I have reached a point last week when I have had enough.He saw me in the last minute by the door with all my things packed.

This past month he married her (quick paper-signing ceremony which we FaceTimed in for)Now they are applying for a spousal visa. To be honest, it’s all a bit quick to my mind, but they seem happy, and she seems like a nice person so I’m trying to be supportive, in spite of my concerns.

She’s never set foot in Canada, and has married him and agreed to move here. )My family thinks I am just being negative and unsupportive, so I keep those concerns to myself now. The immediate problem lies with the reception he is planning for the summer. He would like everyone in our immediate family and some close friends, to come to Turkey.

I know these are not unreasonable things to ask as I’ve been married twice myself!). It has culminated in a fight, where he stopped speaking to me. To date, he’s not said a word to me for 3 weeks.

10vne8x,20,"Myself and friends 1+2+3 have had a lot of good times. Skiing, biking, travelling etc. I introduced them all to each other about \~3 years ago. The've been my core group of friends and we're all living far from home.I've a tendancy to want to help people do things I think they should do and I often get overly excited about doing it. Since friend 3 moved here, I've helped him:Get a car. Find a house to buy. Get a new bike, followed by bikes 2-4 as he got better and wanted upgrades. Get a job with my employer. Get an upgrade on his phone. With snowboarding and getting all the right gear.I tend to pester people about this. Especially if they say how ""overwhelmed"" they are or how ""nothing ever goes right for them"". That's bait to me.I found out I have ADHD about two years ago, bought a house needing renovations six hours away with no real way to pay it off. Bought and sold \~15 cars, purely as I get bored of them. Travel as much as I can and often rack up debt in doing so. Take liberty with working remotely by skiing or collecting home reno supplies from far away.I can be wreckless and annoying to someone with a contrasting personality.I've REALLY been working on this for the past two years.The problems arose when friend 3 didn't do his part:The car was an enthusiast one, but he didn't do preventative maintenance and it's constantly let him down. My identical car had been faultless. My house turned out to be a lucrative buy and he could have bought the house across the street for similar money to me. He took too long to think about it and a cash offer was accepted a few days later. He made money on each of the bikes he bought, but each had issue that arose with them from lack of maintenance. He got the job, hated it and left two years later. He followed me snowboarding onto a jump where he went way faster and hurt himself. I brought him to hospital (everyone else said it was bruising). Stayed with him for the night and he had a broken pelvis. I'm blamed for all of the above.9 months ago, my phone contract ended. He was a line on my account. I found a new monthly deal where we'd be paying 1/3 of our existing rate, he just had to buy out his contract. He didn't like his phone, so gave it to his mom and used his old phone (blamed me for recommending it). I offered to pay it and he'd pay the same as his existing rate until I was paid back (still saving money).This pushed him over the edge and he swore he wouldn't talk to me again. I messaged him saying ""I still wanted to be friends"". Friends 1 and 2 have stepped back and said ""it's between you two"" as they want to see it as ""six of one, half a dozen of the other"". Every time I left town to work on my house, they'd meet up knowing they could just say I ""wasn't around"".For the last nine months I've been pretty alone, with friend 1 and 2 sharing less about their lives with me.

10vvemh,20,"I have a friend (20F) that I met at group therapy back in the summer. She was having issues with her dad not being there and having a new family, she seemed nice but broken. I kinda related so I talked to her for a few days and we swapped numbers. She quit going to therapy a few weeks later.She uses me as an emotional dumping ground, every single day. For every problem in her life and undealt with childhood trauma. It’s almost like she can’t think for herself, she comes to me with everything. Whether it’s problems with herself, her dad, problems with her mom, problems with relatives, problems with people online, etc. It’s getting to be too much. I’ve also found out per her sister that she made up several stories to me, about what her mom or dad said to her and just her general home life. She portrays her parents as horrific people. They are pretty lenient and very few expectations. She grew up spoiled and got whatever she wanted which is the opposite of what she told me. (Her parents aren’t millionaires but upper middle class) She’s made up horrible stories about them and situations with relatives that never happened, accused her relatives of doing things they never did. She posted pictures with the relatives in question. But she said they stopped talking years ago. She tried to play it off as old pictures, when it’s clearly recent. If I call her out on a lie, she covers it up with another lie. Always has a story ready to go. She doesn’t get along with people on social media and portrays herself to be this extremely arrogant wealthy person, who travels all the time, who parties all the time, she brags about everything she has, she pretends to be on vacations and pretends she flies private, pretends her parents are millionaires, she even goes by a fake name and location. She comes to me with what people are saying about her, everyday. None of it is positive, yet she feeds off of the negativity and she says awful things back about them and makes fun of them. I have asked her why she keeps doing it and she gets mad and tells me to stay out of it. She’s been doing that everyday for months.I feel like it’s the same stuff, different day. I have given her numbers for help in our area, I have given her links to self help books, I have suggested going back to therapy. I have tried to be a supportive friend, she gets mad when I say anything positive about her. She’s so wrapped up in the social media drama that she created. Either that or drama at home which is also of her doing. She ignores what I have to say when I try to give advice and keeps going on and on about the same things. She will send me text after text, if I don’t answer. Keep calling my phone. Get mad at me if I say I’m busy. If I tell her about anything in my life, she ignores it and talks about hers. It’s very one sided convos and it’s been like that for a while now.

10vnb9k,133,"TLDR: I feed feral cats, my neighbor doesn't like it and is leaving bags of cat poop on my property.I moved into my current house - a duplex - in March of 2020. There was a colony of feral cats that hung out on the property, and the previous tenant left food and water out for them, especially during the hot Phoenix summers. Houses up and down the street do the same thing; there are at least like six colonies on our street. So I've kept up feeding them and grown to like them - they're cute and entertaining. My duplex neighbor, who lives in a converted garage behind my house, also feeds them.Late last year, a new family moved in next door, and the owner doesn't like cats. He asked me if I would stop feeding them, because he was allergic and he didn't like cats near his house.I told him I'd think about it, but that lots of houses on this block feed them, and they weren't likely to just go away if I stopped. They've been here longer than us. I'm not inclined to stop feeding them.Since then, I've found several bags full of cat poop on my front porch. My duplex neighbor who lives behind me also found a bag of cat poop apparently thrown over the fence.Am I being an asshole?&amp;#x200B;EDITED TO ADD: The cats had their ears tipped when we moved in. Since then, we found a few new ones and attempted to Trap/neuter/release but weren't successful.

10vjs3d,22,"I (18F) have recently moved out of my mums house. She lives at home with my two younger brothers. I moved out and moved 300 miles away for university, however I have since dropped out but I decided to stay in the area and move into my boyfriends house (he lives near the uni I went to). My mum has been sick for some time now. She has fibromyalgia and some other conditions, as well as having to look after my two younger siblings who both have behavioural issues. She’s a strong woman and I do feel sorry for her. Since moving in with my boyfriend, I have started a new job and began a new life here. However, my mum has recently had to have some tests as she has suspected cancer. Since then, she has been on my back about me moving back up to her home and wanting me to move back in so I can help her, as if she was to be diagnosed with cancer, she would need a lot of help. I understand this, but I have started a new life here and I do not want to drop everything to help her. All of my family live near her, including my older brother who still lives at home. My brother works and lives at home rent free. He is expected to do no housework, and if she asks him to do something, he always says no and she just accepts it? Why does he not have to help but I do, despite being so far away.  I don’t understand why she’s putting so much pressure on me to move back home when she has a lot of people to help her anyway. If I was to move back home, she would want me to cook, clean and do all the childcare. I would not be able to have my own life, not even a job. I have only recently turned 18, and I don’t wanna waste my early adulthood on this. I am more than happy to help her. Since moving out, I still do childcare. I sit and play games with my brothers via FaceTime and even send money as gifts for them. During the school holidays, I can even offer a place for my brothers to stay if they wanna come down and spend some time with me for the week and give my mum a break. I do not know what to do, and I don’t know if this makes me incredibly selfish or not. She’s putting a lot of pressure on me. She hasn’t even got a diagnosis yet. I know it can be a scary time for anyone. The sheer anticipation of waiting for the test results must be awful. This is the second time she’s had to go through this, the first time luckily didn’t amount to anything, and wasn’t cancer. Every time she gets a letter in the post from the doctor, she sends a picture to me, like she’s trying to get it to stick it my head that she might have cancer. Almost like she’s trying to scare me. She reminds me almost everyday, sending texts that’s she might have cancer. It’s making me very stressed, and I do not want my family to hate me for not moving back up to help.

Sarah told me that she is dating Michael, and upon seeing my shocked face was very curious to know what I knew about him.

I also know that Michael would be absolutely pissed if/when he finds out that I said anything about him. I feel justified saying what I said because if describing Michael’s actions and behaviors makes him look like a shitty/undesirable person, well, maybe he is a shitty person, and I don’t owe it to him to try and hide that fact from others. I do feel a little bad for Michael though, because I don’t know him super well and because people can change and should have some opportunity for fresh starts.

10vqnes,28,"I know it sounds terrible, but let me explain first. For context, my mom is an alcoholic as she has been throughout my whole life. A few weeks ago, she got so drunk that she fell right on her arm and broke it (This isn’t the first time she’s broken a bone over drinking too much alcohol) It was late &amp; i got awoken by her screaming bloody murder and tried to help her off the floor because i didn’t know what was wrong. She started screaming obscenities at me and just being really mean and loud, overstimulated and panicking i left and hid in my room as my brother and my moms bf tried to help her. She did the same thing to them. I then hear her yelling across the house that we don’t give a fuck about her and how she hates us and wants us all dead and we never checked on her, and it really upset me because obviously all of us tried to help. her boyfriend tried explaining that we did in fact check on her, but she was being delusional. I yelled at her boyfriend and told her this is exactly why he needs to make sure she’s more responsible with alcohol, and i told my mom if i didn’t care about her i wouldn’t be standing there (at this point i was in the kitchen and they were on the couch and my living room is next to my kitchen) My mom then randomly brought up my father (deceased) and told me that on valentine’s day before he died, he got her a dozen roses, 6 dead because their love was “half alive because she decided to keep us” i absolutely lost it at that point. at that point i probably blacked out from rage and blew off on her. she hid under the covers and didn’t say anything after i was done. I told her she was awful for that and she had no reason to bring up my dad like that &amp; basically called her out for being a raging alcoholic and that’s why my dad probably left(it’s kinda blurry i just know i was really mean) Since my mom broke her arm, Shes been asking me to do things i'm uncomfortable with, such as changing her and wiping her ass. If i refuse it, she makes me feel awful and says ""oh i get it all my kids hate me and are gonna put me in a nursing home one day."" She doesn’t ask my twin brother anything, and I think it's because he told her she needs to learn how to do shit by herself, as he has had a broken arm before and has trained himself to use his other hand for tasks and writing. Or maybe it’s just plain favoritism or i’m her favorite target to pick on because she feels like she can get a reaction out of me. She keeps asking me why I have an attitude and i’ve stayed silent, but the truth is i don’t want to be around her. Being around her gets me in a really bad mood and it’s just really draining. I’ve thrown myself into work just to get out of the house because being around her is bad for my mental health.

10vsm0z,26,I (22f) just got engaged last year. I never was a person that wanted a wedding as I don’t want to deal with the stress and money. However my fiancé wanted a wedding so we agreed to have one and I’m trying to make it the best we can both enjoy. When I was deciding to chose my moh I was stuck between two friends for privacy reasons I won’t use real names friend “A” (22f) has known me for almost 10 years and recently moved away 5ish hrs away. Friend “B” (40f) is a coworker and we became really good friends and have a like a motherly/daughter but also friend kinda of friendship. I see a moh as not only someone who is close to me but who will be there for me every step of the way and take stress of me of wedding planning and really take on the role and knowledgeable. Because  what I saw the role of moh doing I chose friend B. I love friend A but she won’t be available as much to plan or be there in big moments like dress shopping. I sent a message when friend A asked me who I chose and I explained to her my reasons and how I love her but I really need the most support as I am really bad with stress and overthinking. She said okay but since then she keeps asking me over and over again if she’s the maid of honor and my friend matron instead which I didn’t want to do as they both don’t know each other very well and having to juggle between both of them and keeping them updated and the same page seemed to much stressful for me. I kept declining and sweetly reminding that friend B is my moh. Today she asked again during a call and I jokingly said “girl i told you so many time lol” and again said friend B is my moh. She just said “just making sure!” And I told her to give me a second and I guess she thought I was away from my phone and started to talk to her mom about how I didn’t choose her but she can’t say anything to me because it’s my choice and how I asked her to me my moh and I changed my mind which is not true I said I was thinking between her and friend “B” but I didn’t have a decision yet at the time. And I just feel bad because I felt like I let her and her family down when I’ve known them for a long time.

I've been sleeping in her living room which doesn't allow for a lot of alone time until she goes to bed. My grandmother takes care of my second cousin N (27f) and my first cousin S (6f, not important to the story). Throughout N's mom's pregnancy, she smoke, drank, did drugs, etc. That caused N to be special needs and my grandmother took her in to raise her (N's mom didn't want her). She has a hard time understanding certain things (like she overstayed her welcome). Now onto the main event.So after watching some TV with my grandma, she heads to bed with S. N doesn't have a set bedtime, and neither do I. So after they head to bed N goes to her room for the night. I decide to go into the kitchen while my mattress blows up. I notice a mango close to rotting on the counter and decide to give it to her. I take the mango to her room and all is well. I return to the bed and get the idea to ""please"" myself and get to it. Abt halfway through I hear N coming down the hall and quickly stop. She goes to the kitchen to cut up the mango (she waited a long time before going to cut it up). Although irritated I understand that it was my fault for not cutting it for her or leaving it for the next day. I wait for her to finish until she comes freaking out because she cut up the mango after her eating curfew (she can't eat after 9, I didn't know this). So I calm her down and tell her to just put it in the fridge and eat it tomorrow. She puts it into the fridge and I expect her to go back to her room but she instead sits down on a nearby couch and starts a conversation. Even though Im still irritated I try to be nice and smile. She notices my discomfort and tells me she told grandma that she thinks I hate her (this isn't her first time randomly starting long conversations with me late at night but I never said anything). I decided to tell the truth. I told her that I don't hate her but enjoyed my alone time. I explain that it's not just a her thing, that I would feel this way abt anyone.

10vqp6u,7,"Sorry for any formatting issues, mobile is difficult to work with. I (15F) have a cousin (14F), we'll call her Ava, who typically comes to my room to gossip whenever they visit, then disappear until they have to leave. Throughout the last year or so, they've been ranting to me about how they were dating so and so, dumped them, started dating blah blah, rinse and repeat. These 'relationships' last a week at the very least. And every time, they always talk bad about their exes. Some of them, I understand. One guy who can't take a hint, cheating, etc. But then there's ones where Ava seems to be all over them, then treats them like a speck of dust. For example, she liked... let's say Ryan. She would gush over Ryan's hair, talk about nothing else, yet claims she loves him. Then suddenly, two weeks later, he's a monster the next time she comes to gossip. I honestly cannot grasp my head around the fact that they've dated well over 10-15 people at this point, and somehow all of them are in the wrong. And again, I do understand some were cheaters and one, with proof on her end, could not take a hint after they broke it off.

So my little brother (14 M) hates doing chores as we all do. Well while im doing my chores ( which is the bulk of the house since i am the only girl out of all 4 kids) and i ask him if he can clean the living room. Easy enough right? wrong. he comes downstairs and pickes up some trahs off th ground and obviously there’s more to do like put shoes away and hang up coats and such.He goes back upstairs to go do whatever he wants. I of ouse see the dirty living room and he is nowhere to be seen and of couse i tell his name so that he comes down and cleans what i told him to clean. i am frustrated because this happens almost on a daily basis. he comes down and i have to tel him step by step what to do. why he can’t just do it without me telling him to “put away the shoes” i have no idea but it’s not ideal for oth of us and i want him to do his chores even thought this is one of the easiest things to do in the house. i am of course being rude i am stressed and annoyed that he can’t prolly do his job. he finally finishes after all that and goes upstairs. my mom however is not happy. she will always take his side in anything. She says “well he doesn’t want to do anything for you because your so rude and negative” meanwhile my brother won’t listen, is very rude, and impatient and constant saying he doesn’t want to do it.

10vl8f7,26,"Throwaway and on mobile, all fake namesSo the issue is that I (18F) forgot to attend my friend's (19M) father's vigil this past Friday but I also don't really feel bad for it. Backstory:I think it's important to mention that I used to be really close friends with him, who will now be called James. But we haven't really hung out or even talked to each other since late September. Anytime I would want to hang out with him and his boyfriend (20M) Jacob, I would need to set up the time, location and activity. We used to all set up details together but that was 6 months ago or more.Our group had a falling out when James and Jacob would always side with the bully of the group and they let our friend Alex(19NB) leave the group instead of the bully which didn't sit right with me. The last time we did hang out was in November to visit Alex who lives 45 min away. Jacob and James didn't want to drive because it seemed to both Alex and I that they didn't really care if they went to see Alex or not. Before this I would say hi to them if I saw them and we might have a 3 minute conversation if that. I am just trying to establish that I didn't really know anything about them anymore and we weren't really close friends anymore. Now to the problem. This past Christmas James told me that his dad had passed a couple of days after the 25th. I responded with the usual ""oh no my condolences reach out to me if you need anything I'm here for you."" However when he first told me my first thought was oh well and I was ready to move on with my life. I have never had a conversation with James' father ever in the 5+ years I have known him. I didn't tell James my reaction because I am not an idiot but that's the last I thought of it.Until this past Tuesday when James mentioned that his dad's vigil would be Friday. When I first read the text I thought that I probably shouldn't go because I had such an insensitive reaction to his death and I didn't want James to be more hurt. Then I literally forgot to reply to the text. I did not commit to going or ever said anything like that.Well this Saturday Jacob texted me and asked why I didn't go and I told him I forgot and that I had screwed up not saying anything. Jacob then started going after me saying I am a horrible friend and that I should be there comforting James in his time of need.But reaching out is a two way street and neither one of them have tried reaching out to me for months?

I have known my friend for about 1 1/2 years and we were instantly close after we met through our sport. Everything was fine last year, we didn't have the same lunch before but we would hang out on weekends, text non-stop, talk every passing period possible, and talk during practices, and we would always confide in eachother. Lately however (past couple months) I had been inviting her to just as many things as normal and she would say no to everything or say she would then back out. Then since school started I've needed to talk once cause I was super stressed and had some news to share and so I asked for 1 single lunch to hang out and talk like we used to so we could talk, she didn't show up, gave no excuse, and we didn't talk for a week until she finally apologized. Getting back to it, I finally confronted her and asked her how we are friends if she never wants to hang out, talk, and I am only her online friend pretty much that she calls whenever she has an issue. We went back and forward for a while then after I thought I started to get my point across, she flipped out and accused me of something and then when I calmly defended myself she just never responded and we have been ignoring eachother for a week now.

10vr00t,108,"For the sake of this post i'll refer to myself as Anne and my sister as Jane. My sister jane had severe mental health problems as a child and was in and out of psych wards for years. At the time I tried to be a better sister to her bc I did feel I caused most of it due to bullying her when we were kids. I apologized to her over and over for it. Basically in highschool I started subconsciously coping her, isolating myself from ppl making fun of myself in my head and directing hate at myself and thought it felt so good. I liked being alone and the feeling of self hatred and it basically led to me going from a healthy weight to a very dangerous low weight somewhere in the 60s. I became addicted to making myself feel as miserable as possible taking a bunch of ap classes and three languages to put pressure on myself and would stay up all night feeling good when I deprived my body of sleep and water and food and stopping brushing my hair till it got so matted it needed to be cut off. This continued all through out high school I kept it to myself and no one cared in my family and I liked knowing that. The thing is it was all fake I convinced myself of all these lies that I was worthless, disgusting and a burden to make myself sad so i could be like my sister Jane but my sister truly felt this way I did not. Last year I fell down the tiktok rabbit hole and tried to convince myself I was autistic just like my sister and subconciously acted autistic and I was angry and jealous of my sister that she gets to be special and have a reason to be weird I don't as I am just a failed human who failed to launch as I am not in collage or have a job currently but there is nothing preventing me from doing so. I know that was very wrong of me, I was bambarding my friend with all these fake struggles just to feel validated.

10vlm2c,36,"So I (m/26) have been dating my gf (f/27) for 4 months now. Things have been great, we have alot in common, and i get along well with her family for the most part. But, our main arguments lately have been about her parents refusal to allow her to spend the night with me at my apartment. I have told her repeatedly that she is too old to be asking for permission and that she needs to put her foot down or her parents will never change and I worry they will begin interfering in other aspects of our life.&amp;#x200B;For some background: my gf still lives with her parents, but she has a full time job, her own vehicle, does not smoke or drink, or even go out unless it's with me or her sister, and even pays some rent to her parents. But they will not allow her to stay with me and will call and text if she's out with me ""too late"" usually around 10pm saying it's time to go home. She tells me she has tried talking to them multiple times but it gets her nowhere and has even told them how it's not fair that they let her younger brother (m/21) spend the night at his girlfriend's and they have flat out told her it's because he's a male. We made plans to spend Thanksgiving, New Years, and a few random nights together but each time her parents will not allow her. Last week we got into an argument over it and we spent maybe 2 hours talking about it late at night. I had a text from her dad asking where she was and when i called him, he said how they were worried and about to go looking for her, and how i need to make sure ""it doesn't happen again"". I didn't have my phone on me and i never heard hers go off so i did not know they were even reaching out. She had another conversation with them and at first they said she was grown and knew what she was doing so we decided to spend the night that weekend. Well she comes over and at 11pm they start telling her to go home. We got into a huge fight over it and i said some hurtful things like ""i want to be in an adult relationship"", and ""you need to tell them to fuck off"". Granted i could've worded things better but i let my frustration get the best of me. I told her i hate having my time with her dictated by others and how we have to put plans on hold (like going on trips) because of her parents. She mentioned that her dad told her before we even met that as long as she lives there, she needs to come home for the night. My gf is asking me for patience and understanding and that eventually they will ease up, but it's getting more and more difficult for me to accept the situation.I have asked why she's so afraid of standing up to them and she tells me it's because she does not want to strain her relationship with them and is concerned they will kick her out, for which she does not have the money to move out right now, so she wants me to respect their wishes.

10vuy1c,9," A few months ago I started dating a girl with a psychological disorder, but she's still just an amazing girl and it doesn't really affect our relationship (despite the distance).  Obviously I know that this brings difficult situations and that the way to deal with it is different, there's always one more concern, but that's okay, because since I asked her to date I knew I would deal with things like that. At the end of last year, we agreed that we were going to meet each other's families and so I went to spend 10 days at her grandmother's house and when I returned, I asked my mother if my girlfriend could spend New Year's Eve with me, even to meet them and what I received was a nice scolding disguised as advice.  For other reasons, we ended up not spending New Year's Eve together and we agreed that on the first weekend of this year, I would bring her to my house and then she could meet my parents. As soon as she arrived here, my mother treated her with a certain indifference and my father, when arrived, the same way.  I was a little bummed about it, but I wasn't going to let it ruin the weekend with her. On Sunday, I drove her home and came back in the afternoon.  At night, my parents called me and they just started talking very badly about my girlfriend, saying things like ""She's incapable"", ""You're going to jail"" and even saying that ""We try so hard for you to be successful and you show up with such a problem here at home"".  My father almost forced me to break up with her, saying that if I didn't, he wouldn't help me anymore.  It destroyed me, it made me feel so bad that I went back to having depressing thoughts and a certain desire to give up on life.  I felt so guilty simply for loving my girlfriend that it made me look for therapy for the nearest day possible, simply because I couldn't take it. It went away for a while, I was in a bad mood with my parents for a week, but every time I said something about my girlfriend, they scowled. This weekend, for health reasons, my girlfriend had to go back to live with her grandmother and as she was going to take a lot of things, I went with her to help and to spend the weekend with her.  My parents were very against the idea to the point that when I was leaving, they said ""You know you're upsetting us. You've never given us heartbreak until now"".  And I left the house on Friday again with that weight of guilt, but I enjoyed the weekend and enjoyed the time I had with my love. Today when I came back, my mother has a kind of frown on me and said that my father is sad and depressed around the corners, crying because of me and now, again, I have this huge weight of guilt for all of this.

10vqbsb,9,"My best friend (19F) and I (20F) have been living together for 6 months now and recently had an argument that may lead to her getting kicked out. We have been really good friends for about 10 years. For college my father sold our house and bought a townhouse near campus for me. I know she is a messy person, since we have met she has never had a clean bedroom. Before moving in together she said she would make an effort to keep the common space clean and her bedroom isn’t my concern which is fine with me. I like to keep a clean space, while I don’t deep clean I will pull out a vacuum and wipes if I notice something. I also don’t like seeing the sink full with dishes so I often unload/load the dishwasher. The one chore I don’t do is the trash because I feel I do enough around the house and she has been taking it out ever since we moved in, never complaining about me not doing it. Though, she doesn’t do it regularly and it often overflows. That’s where the argument started. She sent a message saying “can I set a new rule for us? If you see trash actively opening the lid and one of us knows it’s full. We have to take it out and not just shove more trash on top”. To me this is basically asking me to take part in her one chore when I’m already doing the other 5 chores. When I tried to explain this to her I was met with a paragraph of text calling me a martyr because I never asked her to do any of that stuff and that she was forced to do trash even though this is how things have been for the last 6 months. When I suggested taking out the trash more often so it doesn’t pile up (which I don’t find to be much more inconvenient and she agreed in the past) she just said no and that she isn’t asking much. To try n fix this my bf set up a chore list and tried to throw into that conversation that she needs to cleanup after cooking because recently her food rotted on the stove for days. Her reason? She’s often “too high” to clean afterwards. Another reasoning for her never helping w vacuuming and other chores is because I never asked her. I wasn’t aware I needed to treat her like my child. I no longer want to speak to her because she hasn’t apologized.

My parents really want us to mend our relationship, but I don't know how or even if I want to. For backstory, we have never gotten along. We were both horrible to each other in different ways growing up and that has led to a lot of resentment between us. I won't go into detail about what he did, but I was a jerk for calling him stupid a lot. I got better grades than him and was mean about it. He is actually way smarter than me in most ways, I just liked school so I did well in that environment. I realized what an AH I was as a kid and have tried to apologize and make an effort to be kinder to him since I figured it out. He was also awful to me in other ways, but has never apologized or shown any regret. I think because he feels justified for it. 3 years ago we had to share a room during a family gathering and he was watching a show while I was trying to go to sleep. I asked him to wear headphones, but he said he couldn't. I don't know why he couldn't. He said he was trying to keep himself awake because a friend who was struggling with something was going to call him. I have sensory perception disorder and struggle with noises and definitely can't sleep with a TV show on. We argued for a bit, I called him selfish (which I admit was wrong, especially if he was trying to be a good friend), and went to sleep in my car. It sounds dramatic, and probably was, but I was tired and it was the only option at 2 am. I just wanted to remove myself from the situation and go to sleep. Since then, he won't speak more than a couple of words at a time to me and only if I initiate. I tried to apologize several times in the following months, but he would ignore me. Christmas of that year I wrote him a letter apologizing and got him a thoughtful gift. I'm pretty sure they both went in the trash.

I already had most of my classes figured out like algebra 1, psychical science and more. But then electives came. One of the people said it was better to leave some extra period to study in, and my original plan was to do that. I had picked to do concert band which took place every other day.

10vogwi,54,"Financial context: My(23M) girlfriend(24F) has been living with me for one year and before she moved in we had a talk and I told her the only way it would work is if she pays $400 twice a month so that I know she’s serious about living with me and because I didn’t want the added expense of her living with me to slow my progress towards my goals. (I had just gotten my first apartment and I wanted to fully furnish it which it took me 8 months and 20k to do.) I get $2,500 every two weeks after tax and after paying for our expenses, bills, entertainment, our phone bills etc. I’m left with between $600 and $900 every two weeks and that’s what I’ve been using to furnish my home for the past year. What I ask:Her only contribution besides $400 twice a month (cost of living: $4,000 minimum before trips)  is cook the food I buy for us both (typically once or twice a day depending on if we’re working that day) and keep the place clean. She makes most of the mess and it’s not a big apartment.Where I could be the asshole:I can’t get her to cook or clean and i took over cooking for myself because she kept throwing it in my face when I brought up cleaning but now she still doesn’t clean. She has had 3 jobs and quit 2 of them leaving me to pay her share for 5 months total. I’m not sure if maybe I’m not seeing her perspective but I literally don’t ask for anything else. When we go on vacations I provide 100% of it. The plane ride, food, activities, hotels/cabins/Airbnbs and she just has to show up and have fun. I’m starting to feel used and taken advantage of and I communicated all of my concerns but nothing has changed. I’ve had her say things like “it’s your cat” or “it’s your clothes” and sure but I don’t say “it’s your job why do I have to take you” “it’s your food why do I have to pay” “it’s your phone bill/phone/hygiene/clothes” I do all I can to provide her with a comfortable life. All I ask is that she stop leaving a mess all over the house and keep it clean. TLDR: 1. I pay for just about everything, living expenses, vacations/outings, her new phone and bill so she could have a super computer in her pocket to make her life easier. Anything she’s asked for within reason and everything we could possibly need. I take her to and from work or I buy her bus passes for when I can’t. 2. She quit her jobs without having a backup plan even though I told her that was a bad idea leading me to have to pay her promised portion for months which brings her total non paid months to 5 and she’s only been here 10 months 3. I can’t get her to cook or clean and so I took over cooking for myself so that she could focus on cleaning and that didn’t work either. 4. making me feel used and unappreciated which I have communicated to no avail.Maybe I’m not seeing it from her POV but if I were in her shoes being spoiled and provided for the least I could do is keep the house I live in for almost free clean and cook the food I don’t have to pay for to show I appreciate it",AITA for expecting more from my girlfriend?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vogwi/aita_for_expecting_more_from_my_girlfriend/

Throughout the day I kept getting picked on. Comments like “if you don’t know about it then just shut the fuck up” when I suggested something and “I’ve been done with this conversation for like 30 minutes” when I was talking about naming our business and asking his opinion. And weird comments that I assumed were joking at lunch like “if you don’t start finishing all your food I’m gonna stop buying it”. Eventually I got fed up and decided to take his comment to heart and shut the fuck up. I said nothing and was just silent and indifferent and gave short responses. I was tired of being embarrassed in public and in front of his friend and just in general. Then we got home and I went and took care of the dogs and unpacked and then suddenly he was short with me when I tried to help him bring stuff into the house. He said he was “tired of my attitude” and that “there are four rooms go pick one” so again I did. I chose our room obviously bc I wasn’t going to pretend I did something worthy of giving up my bed. And I took a shower made my own dinner and went to bed all while he avoided being in the same room as me. He is off work this week and so I got up this morning and got ready and left and then came home from work and still no words have been exchanged.

I love my lady to death but long distance is fucking killing me. We live together and have for the past 6 months, I have never felt more alone than I do now that I have no contact with her. Because there’s no context it’s really been having me think about my life and if I’m ready to be with one person and my answer keeps coming to a no. My parents got together at 14 and are now divorced and have many regrets of not spending their youth finding the right one. I am very worried that, that is something I am going to regret. I really don’t think I’m ready for marriage but I love my fiancé so much. I don’t know how to tell her this and for it to end with us still together. When we told my family about us getting engaged I wanted to wait until she got to know the family a little better, when I told her this she got pretty upset and kinda pressured me into telling my whole family because “I shouldn’t be worried about what they think”. I’m really close with my family and I don’t really bring my partners around them. I have brought my fiancé around but only around my main family like first cousins and grandparents type family. I am pretty close with the rest of my family and they have only met her once. I am the first grandchild of the family to be getting engaged even though our relationship is the newest one compared to my cousins.

This is  important, it think.My friend  (lets call him Carl) was complaining about a teacher ""discriminating""  against him. So basically he has a bad reputation of not doing work and  lying to the teacher about it. He claims he was being discriminated  against because a recent teacher sent him to the counselor to get work  done (when he did finish his work) , while another kid (who did less  work than him) did not get sent to the counselors office.We  meet at our hangout spot and I'm talking to my teacher about Elden Ring  and I hear the argument. I ask one of the guys (lets call him Frank)  wtf is going on and he explains the entire thing. Frank was saying that  it was Carl's fault because of his bad reputation and to go easy on the  teacher since she was new.Carl  appears distressed but not too much (the kind of distress when you are  annoyed with a teacher rambling, at least I think), and claims that he  is going to get revenge against the teacher by ""acting like a bitch  around her"". I tell him to chill tf out since the teacher is new, and he  shrugs it off, and Frank calls him immature for doing so and childish.I  decide to make a snide remark, to try and lighten the mood as it is  getting a little tense, and I turn to Frank and say: ""Most Mature  Marine"" (Carl was joining the Marines). Frank makes a comment saying  lightheartedly: ""No wonder they eat crayons"".Right  then, Carl gets up and leaves the room saying: ""Good Luck"" and just  leaves.

10vn393,15,"Ok, a bit of context here. (BTW, english isn't my first language so expect gramatical errors)  I (18M) am in highschool, and I have this friend of mine (18M). He isn't the smartest student out there, and his habits doesn't make it any better. He doesn't pay attention in classes, he sleeps through them and sometimes he even skips them. He only texts me to ask for the homework, ask for help in something or those type of things. So, as you can see, by his own he would probably repeated year like 2 or 3 times. I'm going to be honest, his projects are AWFUL, not remotely close to what the teacher asked for, and it's not because he doesn't understand the topic or the teacher is bad at teaching, it's all because he doesnt makes any effort on paying attention and improving his works wich all look like a thing a 5 year old kid would do on Sunday night. I usually help him because normally it doesn't takes me a long time, and I even correct some minimal mistakes on his works so he can get a good grade.Now, the problem is, I'm getting tired from this, I am feeling used. So for the last months, I have slowly started to ignore his messages and/or pretend I didn't see them. And if empathy wins, I only help him with what he exactly asked help for, but he hasn't stopped. Now, into the real problem. Everytime we have a project, he sends me his the night before, so I can check it and correct him. I have told him that I'm not the teacher, and that I have no idea if its correct the way he did it (Now, obviously I should have an idea, but I say this hoping he gets that I don't really like spending the night reading someone elses project and correcting it).Since I decided to stop helping him. Everytime he sends me a homework or a project, I say ""Yep, perfect mate"" and proceed to ignore him. This gave him a confidence boost, because he tought he was becoming smarter by not needing me to correct his works. But this has brought consequences, wich can be seen on his grades, he has gone from B's to C's or even F's (Not sure if the conversions are well made since my country uses a different system, but you get the idea).It's pretty obvious why this has happened, it's my fault for letting him deliver those badly made projects, and he's on the verge of failing three subjects, and on top of that, he's getting depressed by thinking the teachers simply don't like him and give him a bad grade on a ""Well made"" work.TL;DR AITA for not correcting my friends homeworks and projects, letting him get bad grades and risking his year?",AITA for not letting my friend know his whole school project is wrong?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vn393/aita_for_not_letting_my_friend_know_his_whole/

There were only four of us there, and two of the girls got drunk (totally allowed since one of them was the birthday girl).

Not too harmful. I'm not going to be good at everything, and no one really wins with Uno. As the night went on, they got a little drunker and started cheating at games while still making these comments to me. I called her out on it and she claimed she wasn't cheating (she used her face to save a Jenga tower and would right down three or four points when they only got two).Anyway, I understand that this wasn't the correct response and apologized to her and explained my family was cutthroat with games growing up, so it's something I'm working to undo. She thanked me for apologizing and I missed the text, so I texted back today (Monday) saying, ""I'm trying to apologize when I realize I've done things wrong.

She hit me with, ""You're going to keep apologizing when you've already apologize? I already acknowledged it."" I tried to explain that wasn't what I was trying to say.

I'm very adamant about not wanting him neglecting his time with friends to have more time with me. I appreciate the time we get, but I don't want his friendships to suffer as a result. Though I've met some of his friends, there are a few that he has mentioned often I haven't met, one of them surprisingly being Cassie.Today he lets me know he's going out with a group of friends after work, and that Cassie will also be there since another coworker friend Max (M) will be joining them. At first I wasn't bothered, until he also mentioned that most of the time will be spent with Max and Cassie, and less time with the group as a whole. He asked if I was alright with this or if I'd prefer him cut the time with them shorter. I was honestly, saying I wouldn't be comfortable but didn't want him to have less time with them.Now I'm left with my insecurities, feeling really uncomfortable and unhappy with myself for not just taking his original offer of not spending the evening with them. Every time she's been mentioned, I've gotten nervous or upset but I don't always tell him this or I push it aside and simply listen.

She once stood in the kitchen at 4 AM to scare me, and I called the cops because I felt unsafe, who said they would send a car out. She claimed this never happened, because they legally would have to send a car out. And she has this alibi that she supposedly was drinking water. (Going to mention she clearly has psychosis.)I straight up told her tonight that once I move out, I would get a restraining order to prevent her from ever working with vulnerable adults again. She claimed she would sue me for defamation, and that I would have to pay her legal fees for years to come. I calmly told her that in that case, I would not sign the form to get my name off the lease early.

We have a rocky past though, we always got along but for a period of time a group of girls at our middle school peer-pressured her into bullying me and some other people. After I transferred schools she told me she was sorry and explained how they manipulated her into bullying me and doing some other shitty stuff, but we have been friends ever since.We have supported each other through good and bad times. We both have mood disorders but over the time I have gotten better through therapy and medication, and while she has also started her path to recovery we are not at the same point yet.She has been having trouble with another group of people at her high school and this has swallowed her completely for a year now but I think she’s starting to find some peace inside of her.What bothers me about her is that she can’t stop talking about her problems, I always try to turn our conversations the other way around and while we do talk about other things it seems to me like she isn’t interested in anything else. I know everyone at her school, and I know she’s friends with most of her classmates but I don’t know how to console her anymore when the assholes come at her again.Added to that, these jerks are not *just* after her, they talk shit about everyone at their school and even some of the other people they hang out with (like me) who have nothing to do with the drama, but every time she talks about this she frames herself as the only one getting harassed and has recently started saying it’s just her “main character energy”I know how much all of this hurts her, but it’s overwhelming for me, I want to tell her to stop acting like the main character and to look around at how everyone is affected in the same way by the same people, that she’s not the only one they’re targeting and that I would like to talk about the good things in life with her, but I’m scared she’s going to take it in a bad way or that it’s going to have a negative impact on her mental health.I don’t want to cut contact but it has become increasingly difficult to maintain a healthy relationship when we are at vastly different points in our mental health journeys.So reddit, would I be the asshole if I told her to look around and realize she is not the main character?Edit: I slightly changed the vocabulary used in this post so that my internal conflict doesn’t sound like the plot for a disney channel tween movie",WIBTA if I told my friend she is not the main character?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vtex2/wibta_if_i_told_my_friend_she_is_not_the_main/

This isn't just based on looks or a short passing crush. I've been dealing with these feelings for months, I really like them. I told Xavier and Tally about this a while ago, because I needed someone to talk to. I started hinting to Nathan that I liked them, and they were clear they didn't like me back. I wish that had been the end of my feelings but Nathan is one of my closest friends, and I spend a lot of time with them, so these feelings are still there.Then, a week or so after Nathan rejecting me, I find out Nathan and Xavier are dating. Honestly I was hurt because Xavier knew I liked Nathan and that I still had feelings, but Nathan and Xavier have been friends longer then anyone else, and they are really good people, so I got over my little feelings of jealousy and supported them.Or that's what I thought. Turns out I wasn't okay as I originally thought, it was killing me to see them lovey-dovey with each other while we hung out. So I decided I needed some space to deal with my feelings.On Friday I sent them both a text basically says ""hey, you guys are awesome people and I support your relationship, but for me, my own mental health and the future of our friendship, I need some distance right now.""So today when I went to school, they both left me alone, understanding that I needed space. Turns out though, they may be angry at me. I tried to talk to Tally today during class (we sit next to each other in bio). Tally is our mutual friend, and one of the best people I know.

Now that my 18th birthday is coming up in a few months I was thinking about how I wanted to spend it, my original idea was to fly down to a national park with my long distance boyfriend and spend 2 weeks there. I can’t afford a plane ticket so I thought another way I would want to spend it was to rent a hotel room all alone, order thai or Indian food (which my mom hates and would complain about the entire time), watch a movie, and go to bed early. I struggled horribly with depression and my mom didn’t show much interest in much of my life (from my perspective) so when I told her I wanted to spend my birthday all alone she became very angry with me and told me “it was my right to spend your 18th with you”. In the last few years of every single one of my birthdays she has found something to yell at be about even if I just sat still or slept in for the day. While I do see her point she won’t listen to my side of why I am wanting this, if I bring it up she starts to become a victim and goes and acts very sad on the couch.

So amongst all of us we jokingly talk shit to each other we say stuff to each other just to fuck around and we all know we aren’t serious about what we say. So basically this one friend Brian (not his real name) likes to joke around and talk shit a lot and it’s never serious. Usually, me and Brian go back and forth and we both know the stuff we say to each other we aren’t serious. He does say some stuff that could get under my skin to an extent but I don’t bother saying anything to not cause trouble and I just brush it off. Last year we all decided we wanted to meet each other for the first time and I recorded our whole trip to make a vlog and recently made a video of our trip. Last December we watched it and he noticed in one of the recordings that he breathed heavily a lot he thought it was funny and made jokes about it, he is a little overweight to add context to it. This trip I mentioned will relate to the story. So fast forward now one day we were all talking on discord and randomly he starts shit talking me. Again I didn’t mind it, I just said a few things back it was fine, then he said some things that did annoy me so the whole thing about him noticing himself breathing heavily from our trip it popped into my head and I decided to come back at him and made a comment about that saying “bro, breath heavier.” All of our other friends were laughing like crazy but Brian just went quiet. I immediately realized that it was kinda fucked up so I immediately apologized and he just kept kicking me out of our discord channel then he just ended up getting off for the night. I immediately texted him right after apologizing because I felt guilty about what I said. His girlfriend, another friend in our group thought it wasn’t that bad of a joke and I was told by her that the comment I made he was assuming I was making fun of his weight which I wasn’t and I told his girlfriend that. She believed me and she also told me that she noticed that Brian always talks shit to me to the where he goes a little too far but doesn’t hold back sometimes Yet when I say something to an extent he gets mad about it even though he’s aware of the comment I said. I’m keeping my distance for now because I don’t want to join our discord channel and ruin his mood and eventually make amends with him.

Those two other guys aren’t really “the smartest tools in the shed” and I might sound like an asshole for saying that… But the rest of my classmates agree with me on this one.

We have made progress though and we are going with the nickname he wanted ‘CeCe’ but I am having issues with feeling happy in deciding a first name. Originally, back before we decided on the nickname, I had brought up the name Cassidy— not my first choice, but it is a name I like— but he shot it down, saying it was one of those ‘whitetrash’ names. It’s not a favorite of mine, just a name I liked enough. Months later though, when we were going through C names after deciding on the nn, I found another name I liked, Cleo. Clara was also in our list and was the decided first name for a while, but I just wasn’t happy with it as much either. Anyway, at the beginning I was just really excited that we were actually pregnant (we had gone through fertility treatment) and I was very open to sharing my name ideas with my husband’s parents.

My husband, even though he’ll deny it, sides with what his parents like, and when we asked what they thought of Cassidy, and they said they liked that name, that name shot to the top of the list. His mother disliked the name Cleo and when my husband and I did a name ranking of our C names, Cleo was totally last lol. Clara was liked but I’m just not feeling it anymore, neither with Cassidy.

10vv1qb,28,"TLDR at bottom A few hours ago I went to the ER and while my husband was there with me every step of the way, the mini issue arose when we left. Essentially, my husband (24m) was hungry so we stopped for some pizza on the way back. Before he stepped out, I was reading something out loud (that he wanted me to read to him) he got out of the car and slammed the door in middle of my sentence.  No, he wasn’t angry. He just didn’t think it was necessary for me to finish my sentence (he confirmed this).  While this annoyed me, I brushed it off until my husband started to rush into the box of pizza to get a slice before we head home. Typically I don’t mind, but this man, this lovely man, smacks his gums and I feel annoyance to my core. I’ve asked him many times not to chew in the car if he can avoid it for short drives. Our apartment was down the road. He told me to stop controlling him, and he snatched the pizza from me and yelled. Okay. I can handle that. Then, my lovely husband decided to say that if I didn’t hold his hand while I was upset that he wouldn’t take the dogs out for their nightly walk (so the dogs can do their business). Mind you, considering I just left the ER and was under strict rules of lowering my heart rate and to not under ANY circumstances exercise or walk much, so I was really stressing out at this point and crying. He shrugged off me crying and rolled his eyes. I tried to say something later and he just held his hand up to my face and says that it’s been a long day so he doesn’t want to talk. For clarification, I was in class all day and he was at work prior to me heading to the ER (12-7). I know I’m just being dramatic and I’m not claiming this is some large issue.

10vusmq,10,"    My partner and I have been together for almost two years, and we have been living together for the majority of that time. He moved in with me and my at the time roommate, along with my two cats and my dog, right after graduating college. Before that, he would visit, and he loved my animals to death, playing with them constantly and even buying them toys. Fast forward a year or so, and that is no longer the case.    For the back story on my dog, she is nearly 7 years old and has been with me for 6 of them. She is a rescue, and I didn't have major issues with her until about 3 years ago. My roommate wasn't helping me take care of her as per our agreement, and she started a habit of soiling a specific corner of the apartment when she was left alone. I tried medications, cbd, diapers, everything, and even the vets weren't sure what exactly was happening. So I decided that I would use pee pads and clean after her whenever it happened, I've had special needs dogs before and didn't mind as she was always well behaved otherwise, but stress gets the best of her.    Back to the present, my partner, who has not signed up for a special needs pup, though barely helps to take care of her as is, has asked me to rehome her. His reasoning is that he's tired of coming home to a mess to clean and shouldn't have to deal with an animal like that. I typically am home before him as he works nights, and I prefer mornings and I have expressed that I have no problem cleaning after her because I adore her, but he's decided that she's to leave by the end of the month, or he's letting her run out of the front door, and won't let me get a word in on the matter. She's also been slowly making progress. Her accidents have not been as frequent, and the messes she's had have been smaller, but he won't listen or see it at this point.   I have told him that I want to keep her, that I love her, and that I understand that as a pet owner of an animal that has extra care attached to them that I accept the responsibility that comes with that. Every time that I bring up why I don't understand why that's an issue to keep her, he blows up on me and threatens the relationship. The conversation goes nowhere and leaves us angry and fuming with each other.

My mom kept pulling the same excuse I was sick of hearing, ""Your sister is lazy but she is very hardworking. I will let her do the chores sometime later."" (which is never)I then went on complaining about how not only do I have to now clean up windows but I have to clean bathroom mirrors, the sink, clean up the toilet (including the underside which is really gross cuz there is piss and poo under), and wipe down the shower mirrors. the thing is my mom checks every little speck of the bathroom and mocks/scolds me for not cleaning it well enough. During the argument, I asked my mom to clean up the toilets instead since she wants the area to be completely clean and she went hysterical saying how she is my mother, she has done so much for me, and I should learn to respect her.

Most of the ppl there were women so we were comfortable. That until the admin of the group started being passive aggressive towards me. It was jokingly at first so I didn't pay too much attention, but the admin came to me and said that I was being too flirty and behaved like a bitch in heat. I wasn't offended, mostly confused since the admin also behaved like that but was, yk, trying to come off as a cold hot girl. She wasn't. I told her that. We disagreed. Then she came to me again with the same argument. I left the community but I wanted to return since I like the other ppl there (only my friend knew about the situation). I tried to talk to the admin, helped her understand that her behavior is just her being toxic to herself. She opened up to me and I discovered that she had a trauma. We talked more. Ig I wanted to help her because I was like her too. So... She said that she understands now and will work on her trauma without being hostile to others.A few days later I asked if I could return to the community and she said that her friends, other mods, didn't like the idea of me being there bc I was toxic — I wasn't , really. I cursed a bit, but not on her or them. She blamed me for the situation and said that it was my sensitivity that led to this problem, she also blamed me for being too friendly with everyone in the group. So I decided that it isn't worth it and blocked her. My friend, being aware of the situation, said that they will leave the community as well. And they didn't. When I asked why — they responded that I am being manipulative and toxic bc I make them choose. And this whole argument didn't involve them and they will stay and will communicate with the admin.But is it really toxic that I don't want my friend to be close with the one who slut shamed me?Mind you, we didn't have sex — just really flirty and suggestive.EDT: thank you all for being honest.

10vuj55,6,"So I 15m let my friend 15m borrow my school laptop charger in English last Friday. He typically asks me during English class to borrow it and I do and he usually gives it back to me after class so I don’t have to ask him. Last Friday we were playing a game in English since we finished our work and I forgot to ask him for it back no biggie I had it at 100% anyway and I figured he would give it back to me on Monday. Well come Monday and I asked him where it is and now he is claiming he flat out doesn’t have it. I told him that he was the last one who had my charger and we argued back and forth but I didn’t want it to turn into a fight so we stopped there but I definitely know he has it. It’s fine if he took it home with him by accident cause that happens. I’m just confused because he is the only person who usually ever asks for my charger and no one else has. So I told my mom about it and she said I am too nice and need to be assertive. Also side note, me and my friend have been friends since Kindergarten but grew apart and are in different friend groups and don’t talk much and I am scared of confronting him and he is kinda bold and loud and I am scared he is gonna start getting mad at me and getting agressive and it turning into a full blown argument cause that’s what I feel like will happen since he can be like that sometimes. But WIBTA for trusting my gut instinct and going up and confronting him for this? I know that for a fact he was last to use it but I am just scared about how I should go about this.

But my boyfriend and I been dating for almost 5 months now, in November or October last year my friend was telling me about this girl I should be worrying about because she was trying to go for my boyfriend. (keep in mind we are already dating between those times) And a week ago, my boyfriend told me about her and it sounded kinda familiar but I didn’t think much of it at the time. I realized who she was and I didn’t like her even more after that. Now the next day after he told me, me and my friend were talking about it and she had told me some stuff that he was doing with that girl. Lets say it was him being extremely super duper friendly to her flirting with him. Now of course I got upset, not jealous. I wasn’t jealous because I was more disappointed than jealous and upset. Now believe me, I have trust issues due to past experiences and people constantly mistreating me. So I ended up talking to him about it and we talked and I thought it was good, right? He told me he wouldn’t interact or talk to her at all. Okay well today I saw that girl walking with her friend and her friend was carrying a box of one of my favorite candies, Ferrero Rocher. At the end of the day my boyfriend gave me 2 of them and at the time I hadn’t even had time to think about what I saw this morning. I got in the car, ate them and then thought about it. I text him, “where did you get those candies?” “A friend” “which one?” “(class name), (girls name)” “I hate you”. I’m mad at him even more because my friend, the same one who told me to worry about that girl, told me that my boyfriend was talking to her.

About a month or so I told sofia that I felt like they were leaving me out and she was like “oh ok they’re just like that sometimes” and I was like “uh ok” a few days later she sends me a message about how she spoke to them about it and they all collectively agreed that I didn’t click with them, and that they think I’m different from them, but that she won’t change the way she is with me and that she thinks I’m a great person but I’m just not like them and that I shouldn’t take it to heart.

Prom is still a ways away but since I’m always late buying my dresses this year I wanted to get ahead of everyone else. I was talking with my two friends about dresses and color and style ideas one day at school and the following weekend I went out to get a dress with my mom. I got a dark red dress with a cowl neck line and high leg slit. I sent pictures of it and the other dresses I tried on to my bff and she agreed that the one I ended up getting was the best and we briefly texted about silver heels and jewelry to go with it which my mom and I had already been looking at together. Fast forward to this next school week and my bff is at a doctors appointment so I’m hanging out with our friend Margo at school alone. I remember that I haven’t shown her the dress I got and showed her my pictures and talked about the silver heals I might get to go with it. At the time I didn’t notice anything off and we had been having very good conversations before and after this dress was brought up. Fast forward another week and I hear from my bff that Margo was upset that I got the same dress color and was looking at the same heal style she had talked about the week prior to me purchasing the dress. Apparently out of all the colors we had listed between the 3 of us the dark red she had brought up was the one she had been looking into the most and she had other friends steel her dress ideas the last 2 school dances so when I showed her my dress and heal ideas she thought I was trying to do the same. Until my bff told me about this I didn’t even connect the dots between my dress and the color Margo had been describing. I had tried on every blue, red, and green dress that looked as though it would flatter my body at the store and got the one I liked the best. Even Julia didn’t think about that conversation when I showed her the dress I got and as I already stated. My bff told Margo this and apparently she is no longer mad at me. I texted her to apologize and ask to talk to her face to face but she only responded “it’s fine” which we all know means it’s not. I started off feeling really sorry and sending her lots of apologies, to wanting to get a new dress, to wanting to tell her it’s just a dress color and to get over it, to almost saying I’ll help her get an even better red dress for herself.

A few weeks ago my ""friend"" ""Billy"" got into a but of trouble and could no longer legally drive his car so we agreed to a trade which just happened last night. It's a 2013 Buick lacrosse, a decent car. The other contents of the trade are irrelevant to the subject, namely, the car, so I'm going to leave them out as to not draw focus where it isn't needed. I arrived at Billy's apartment around 9 pm to make the swap and everything goes off without a hitch. We write up a bill of sale and he hands the title over to me. I had already made plans to trade the car to someone else for an SUV so we agreed that it might be easier to just sign the the title over to the next guy instead of him signing it over to me. He took what I gave him and cleared all of his belongings out of the vehicle and I drove it home. No more than two hours pass by and I get a message from him stating that he actually doesn't know if he could legally sell me the car because it's still registered to his uncle and that maybe it was a bad idea. Basically telling me he wants to swap back without actually saying it. He said his uncle might get passed about it etc etc which makes no sense because his uncle signed the title over to him originally. I'm almost 100% positive that he was just having second thoughts and that was the best excuse he could come up with. I told him that it's not like his uncle is going to report it stolen since since he's had it for months and asked him why his uncle would even care if he had already signed it over. He tired to continue building on that but I just wasn't buying it. I suppose it's worth mentioning that part of what I traded him could be consumed and which he had already done to a good portion. Eventually I just flat out told him that I didn't want to be a dickhead about it but a deal's a deal and I wasn't trading the car back. He then informs me that since he didn't sign the title over to me and just wrote a bill of sale that the car didn't technically belong to me and he insinuated that he'd force that hand to get it back.

She agreed.A few days ago she mentioned how she and H were making plans to hangout for a weekend again at the end of March. I asked her if we were taking pur trip before that and she said ""oh...I forgot""Today just before bed we talked about going to take my nephew a present for his birthday one day this weekend and she tried to claim that this was our trip. I said it doesn't count since we aren't staying and only going to hangout for a couple hours before coming home, not the weekend getaway we had originally talked about.She got mad and started going off on how we don't have the money to get a hotel and go off together and how can I expect us to do that. I shot back with how is it that when it concerns me and her we don't have the money but when it's her and H then there is no issues at all. She blew me off, so i grabbed a blanket and pillow and went to lay down on the couch.

Now triss not liking her are too big and too deep to get into here so i will just leave it at that. So anyway i get the call and answer it and she asked to see how i was doing wondering what i was up to i told her all the things i did today and she asked me if i was busy Friday. I told her im working friday and she said she was just wondering because she wanted to know so we could hang out because we haven't seen each other in awhile i left it at that said goodbye and hung up. Triss got a little sour after that i asked what was wrong and she said nothing i said what is it and she just said i wish i was invited i told her no plans were made and she got mad saying but if they were i wouldn't be invited because im never invited. And she started in on me about how i always spend too much money on her and my family and when i go out with them i never answer my phone when im with them im sorry, i got like four people talking to me at once i get distracted and can't pick up my phone so now she isnt talking to me.

10vwy1h,2,"So for context, my(27F) husband(Dylan29M) is from another country (South Africa), and he was born and raised in a city where it got up to 32 degrees celsius during winter. This obviously means that things used for really warm weather here, (crop tops, really short shorts, tank tops, etc.) were the norm there. Kids as young as 9 would wear crop tops and short shorts, and nobody would bat an eye.But he moved to my home-country a few years ago, and that’s where we reside. A few members of his family also live here, others remain in South Africa, others live in NZ or Canada. He’s one of the only guys my parents have approved of. I grew up really conservative so my parents didn’t approve of a lot of guys whether it be due to their race, family, or jobs. Of course, he met all my parents criteria.So, his sister(Lisa, 28F) is one of the family members that stayed in South Africa, she came to our country to visit the family. She alternates who she stays with because she can’t stay with everyone at the same time, obviously. She is currently staying with Dylan and I. The problem took place when their cousin invited a lot of family over, including some of mine (siblings, parents, etc.), but Lisa was also invited.Lisa had never met my parents before, but she knew what they were like so I thought she’d understand. Plus, she knows how I view things. Lisa hasn’t ever been the type to go against your beliefs or argue with them unless they were hurting anyone, she’s a very relaxed and open-minded person.The day of the event came and Dylan and I were getting ready, Lisa was already prepared and waiting in the living area. It was a fairly hot day, so I understand her wanting to dress accordingly but she was wearing a dress with an arguably deep neckline, and it had cut outs at the stomach area, it was around mid-thigh length. I politely asked her to go change at first, but she refused. Said it was a family event and that nobody would care, except my parents. She and I started arguing about this but Dylan was getting impatient and demanding we leave soon. At some point Lisa just said she wasn’t going and left to go visit one of her friends. Dylan has been pissed at me, and more than half the people at the event were disappointed she didn’t show up. I don’t think it was an unfair ask, especially considering the fact that she can’t expect everywhere to be like her home country.AITA?If there's any necessary info I might've excluded, just ask.",AITA For asking my SIL to Cover-up,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vwy1h/aita_for_asking_my_sil_to_coverup/
10vww04,2,"Me and my (male) best friend have been friends for 3 yrs now. We go to the same school, but He lives in a different country, so he has to go to online classes. Sometimes I don’t get time to chat with him since I go f2f (face to face). So back then when the pandemic started, he came to the same school as me (Currently in the present time I have been in the school for 16 yrs ), he didn't do his assignments on time, didn't review for quizzes, etc. Since I’m helpful and I like to help people out. I would help him do his assignments and when he doesn’t review for a quiz, he asks me for answers and since I’m kind hearted, I give him my answers in the quiz. And I always do it. Some of my friends tell me, I shouldn’t be doing that and I should stop it cause it isn’t right. Tbh, I agree with them, but since I’m generous. I couldn’t do that.    So a few weeks ago, we would have exams in a few weeks. And our teachers told us what we would review for the exams and being a good student I would listen to the announcements, but when I saw my (male) best friend that he was online in discord just playing valorant and not listening to our teachers about the requirements for the exams. (Btw when they announced it, it was online, so we were in a google meet.) Ofcourse, I knew he wouldn’t listen and would just use me again.    So 1 more day and exam day tomorrow. At midnight, I made reviewers,listed everything, memorized  important stuff, and read until my brain cells burned out. And at 11:42 pm, I got a notification on my phone and it was from my (male) best friend. The message was, “Hey (my name), do you know what we are going to review for the exams?” I decided to ignore his message and he kept spamming my messages until I had seen or replied. After a few minutes, he had stopped spamming my messages.    The next day, I went home early just to call my other (female) best friend. She also lives in a different country and she also goes to the same school as me. I helped her in science since she didn’t understand the lesson. I volunteered to help her. And she got called by our teacher and she had to do the exams I had recently. So, we both said goodbyes and ended the call. After a few minutes, I got a message from her saying “Girl, I just got a message from (my male best friend) saying, “wanna help each other for the exams?” and I was laughing since he was gonna use my other best friend. I told her to reply to him saying “why? Did you even review for the exams?” and he responded with, “nevermind. Yes, I did review.” and we didn’t reply to him the same goes for him.

10vwqa4,2,"Me (44M) and my wife (43F) got into a disagreement last night about acting, characters and suspension of disbelief.  I have a very hard time watching “behind the scenes” type shows and content because it usually ruins the movie or show for me.  She on the other hand loves watching that kind of stuff and seems to enjoy it more than the actual movie or show it is talking about.  I have no problem with seeing actors and actresses out of character, but don’t like listening to them talk about specific characters or movies/shows that they have done.   I think this stems largely from having most of my fiction come from books while growing up, so every character was very unique in my imagination.  I obviously know that different characters are played by the same performer, and that doesn’t bother me as long as they don’t talk about “how the sausage is made” as it were.  She on the other had did dance and theater in high school and college so is far more interested in the way a show was produced rather than the content of the show.  This usually isn’t a problem and we can watch stuff together and enjoy it.  Afterwords, she goes off to IMDB to find the trivia and goofs and I go off to find out about the characters and world lore.   We also both have engineering degrees and have taught.  She has taught high school and community college classes, and  I have taught community college and university classes in engineering.  We both obviously understand the “teacher persona” you have to adopt when teaching and the fact that teaching is very much playing a role, much like acting.Last night the disagreement got a little out of hand and she said “everyone is always playing a role” and that I was being unreasonable for expecting anyone to ever reveal their true self or true feelings.  At first I tried to convince myself that she was just talking about celebrities.  After trying to clarify the statement it became clear that she really meant \*everyone\*, herself included.  I’ve always thought that we had a very honest and trusting relationship, but now I’m wondering what “character” she plays with me.

10vpp2g,25," So, I (18F) have been dating a guy (21M) for 3 years, we even live together, and things have been great so far, but today we had the worst fight of our relationship. Ever since we began dating, his family has made it pretty clear they don’t really like me, specially his brother and mother. For context, his father basically called me a slut when I first met him, his mother recently called me lazy in the middle of a gathering and his brother said I was the reason my mother was unhappy (because I’m autistic and she still has to take care of me). I swear I haven’t done anything wrong! In fact, I barely even know them (they were terrible to my boyfriend growing up, so he chooses not to see them that often). What bothers me the most is that my boyfriend never defends me, he even laughed once when I complained about it and said they were like this with everyone and that I shouldn’t take it to heart. Well, I’ve explicitly said many times before that I didn’t want to go out with them anymore, and yesterday he asked me to. I caved in and they insulted me (surprise lol), so we had a small fight and I asked him to never make me go out with them again. He agreed and said he was also going to stop talking to them (for his own reasons). So imagine how surprised I was when I found out that not only was he talking to them, but that his brother called me stupid because I’m an introvert (again, I’m autistic) and he knew and didn’t plan on telling me or calling his brother out for it. Not only that, but my bf was going to ask me to stay out of a plan we had made a week ago so that his brother could go. I told him I was done and that I didn’t want to make him choose between me and his family, but he is now telling me he will never speak to them again. I really don’t want to be the reason for that, but the alternative would be breaking up! AITA?Edit: he’s not a predator, he just had his birthday and I’m having mine in march.

Last year i went to las Vegas because family wanted to meet my baby.

10vs1q1,19,"First post, sorry it's long TL:DR below   My girlfriend and I have been dating for around 7 months. Any relationship comes with some stress, but some scenarios I can't make sense of and I don't know if it's me missing something. This one for example made me feel weird and ended in a way I couldn't really predictMy Girlfriend and I sometimes have to go to her parents. After staying and talking with everyone for a bit and playing with the dogs I usually go and play videogames with her little brother. (I'm M:20 and he's M:14.) He's surprisingly good at smash bro's, around the same skill level as me as he beats me quite often. After a few times playing with him a few times I thought it would be cool to friend him online so we can play more and practice. I asked my Girlfriend today to text him, seeing if he would want to add me as a friend to play.    Her response caught me off guard saying ""No, Leave him alone."" Followed by ""It's weird and unnecessary."" I thought it was a kind gesture, after all we got along playing in person and it wouldn't be a everyday thing or anything. She re-stated he was 14, has friends his own age, and the gesture is more weird than nice. I pried a little deeper saying people of different ages can have the same hobby and that maybe she's the one looking at it weird. I was quickly told otherwise, being called weird myself, and told to drop it.   I finished by saying that I don't think I'm not weird. How I just wanted to bond with her family any same way I could. This was shot down immediately with her telling me that her family doesn't like me at all. For a bit of backstory, me and her have struggled with getting her family to like me and vise versa. We are very opposite people, and go about problem solving in different ways. From the outside its very easy to perceive that we don't like each other's company.Her ""adoptive"" family was the exception, actually seeming happy that I was in their company. We had good conversation and; again, I got along with their son through similar hobbies. Apparently that changed sometime recently and she only felt she had to tell me now.I told her what she said was very rude and I am struggling to see anything in her point of veiw. But the conversation didn't seem like it would go anywhere so we had to drop it. I still don't know how I should feel.Thank you so much for reading TL:DR belowI played videogames with my girlfriend's little brother, after asking to add him as a friend online, I was called weird and later told her family doesn't like me anymore.

A couple of days ago her and her bf Daniel 48M  got into an argument (I am not sure how the fight started as I was not there. All information is from my brother Sam 19M  and mother). During the argument he called Sam useless and disrespectful, called my mother a b word, a cheater and said I was useless and ungrateful but he did not stop there. Daniel also said ""Jessica will spread her legs for any N word (but said the word) around. Her boyfriend should get a DNA test on their son because there's no way he's his real son."" Me and my boyfriend (Jackson) 22M have a 2 year old son together and we conceived a month after Jackson returned home from the Military. Jackson is the only man I’ve been with. Daniel thinks that my best friend (Liam) 22M and I had a sexual relationship while Jackson was away and that my son is a result of that. (To put race into perceptive everyone in the story is white excluding Jackson, our son, and Liam). Liam and I have been friends for 11 years and I view him as a brother, sleeping with him is the last thing that has ever been on my mind. Liam has had a crush on me in the past but I have always made it clear to him that I will never be available to him and he accepted that a long time ago. I want to add that I live with my mother while I finish college and Jackson and I plan on moving in together after. Daniel also lived in this house until this argument occurred. Liam has only been over to my house a handful of times and only in the living room other than one night when Jackson myself and Liam all drank together, and Liam slept in my guest room. I have never been in Liam's house and we always meet in public (I do this on purpose because of his past crush on me, he has tried to make moves on me in private, never while me and Jackson were together, so keeping it public is the best way I could think to keep things platonic in his brain without losing my best friend). I have never slept with him and never will, and I have never reciprocated any feelings or misled him. Jackson and I know that our son is his, Jackson trusts me and knows that I am not the kind of person to do these things. My mother wants to let Daniel back into our lives and I am not okay with it. My mother kept us all in a very toxic household with my bio-father and doesn't know when to walk away. I cannot forgive Daniel for calling me a slut, questioning who my son's father is and calling Jackson the N word and also just using the word so casually.

10vjdlm,26,"I (31F) live in the same apartment building as my grandmother (86F), dad’s mom. Grandad died when I was 8, she never remarried and has lived alone in her very small 1 bedroom apartment ever since.My aunt, her daughter, has tried many times having my grandma move in to the spare bedroom in her house, but Grandma is very stubborn and doesn’t want to leave the apartment she has lived in for the last 30y. No one blames her. We just worry an elderly woman is living alone.About 4 years ago, she adopted a couple of cats, brother and sister, spayed and neutered. They are very mellow and sweet, very gentle and lovely, and have always been low energy pets.About a year ago, grandma’s apartment got broken into while she was on a weekend trip. A few days after, she adopted a 3mo male puppy, Max, at a street adoption fair. She was convinced that if she had a dog, it would have barked and avoided the break in.It was the famous Brazilian caramel dog! They said the dog wouldn’t grow too much. Boy, they were wrong. Max grew to be the size of a border collie. Since it’s a small apartment, he has zero space.Grandma only walks the dog once a day, for about 15 minutes so it can go to the bathroom. When he has to go again during the rest of the day, it goes on the puppy pads spread out around the place.Also, he’s very badly trained: he keeps jumping on people who visit, scratches us with his big nails, barks nonstop unless we give him attention, bites as way of playing, destroys furniture and shoes to let out anxiety and terrorizes the poor pair of cats, that spend all day hiding on top of the washing machine cause it’s the only place Max doesn’t get to them. The moment they put one paw on the ground, Max wants to play catch and runs them all over the small apartment. They only come down at night, cause that’s when grandma takes the dog into her room to sleep.We tried reasoning with grandma for the last whole year: we suggested professional training, hiring people to walk the dog a few times a day; I even volunteered to walk him. Grandma said no.A couple weeks ago we heard from a member of her church that she told them Max tripped her on one of their morning walks, trying to chase a random dog. Grandma is a small woman, she doesn’t have the strength to hold him back. And now I can’t even try to help, because I just found out I’m pregnant and it’s a high risk pregnancy.I check on her everyday with calls and random drop ins at her place. Me, dad and aunt have been discussing what to do, because it might not be Max fault he’s badly trained and have this much energy, but unfortunately he’s a danger to my grandma, and the topic of maybe rehoming him came up.

10vj5b2,15,"I (36 M) called in at a small-ish pub for a quick pint and a bite to eat with my fiancee (31 F) on our way home from a day out.When we sat down, there were pair of women behind us with a baby and another young girl aged approx. 7 or 8. They were chatting away happily enough, and we didn't pay much attention - my fiancee and I were just talking between ourselves and enjoying our food.About 10 mins later two men arrive and join the women. One of them is obviously a bit drunk and is complaining that he hasn't seen his child all day, and starts talking loudly and obnoxiously about their friends and family and how annoying they are etc... He picks the baby up and starts singing to it to put it to sleep - fair enough.A bit later on the two women leave, leaving the two men to look after the kids. All seems to be well until the 7 or 8 year old daughter started playing with some cushions on a sofa in the pub after she was asked not to. The dad starts shouting super loudly at the kid and calls her a ""fucking idiot"", which obviously wakes the baby up. When the baby starts crying, he blames that on the 7/8 year old - ""look what you've done now"" etc...Next, he starts asking her about something that happened earlier in the day where she had not done what she was told by one of the two women (presumably mother or stepmother). He said ""I want you to tell me what happened, and don't give me one of your fucking bullshit stories"".Both me and my fiancee couldn't believe what we were hearing. In my mind this is just plain abusive behaviour from an adult towards a child, especially of that age. I was actually surprised that the friend he had with him didn't say something to pull him up on it.We got up to leave at this point, and for some reason I couldn't stop myself from asking him why he thought it was alright to talk to his daughter like that.Needless to say, he absolutely lost it. He handed the baby to his friend so he could square up to me, and asked me if I was a parent (I'm not), and then told me because I'm not a parent I have no business commenting on how others raise their kids.  In my mind, that's irrelevant when the parent's behaviour is as shitty as his.

10vofus,14,"I M(20) am sharing a dorm with my roomate, as part of a 6 person suite. One of my roommates, however, is constantly so loud on the phone. I don't have any issue with him making calls to people (as I myself am on the phone to my girlfriend pretty frequently as we're long distance) however he refuses to use his airpods/headphones. He is a pretty loud person as it is, but when he puts his calls on speaker at full volume it's so much louder. These calls sometimes last hours as he plays video games with his friends/girlfriend. This is frustrating to me because I always try to be respectful to him (for example, by being quieter when I know he's sleeping or taking my calls outside when it's early in the morning) Lately, however, he's gotten so loud that my girlfriend can hear him over me, despite my microphone being right by my face- this makes it hard for us to spend time together like watching movies or shows because she can't hear anything except his conversations. We are both long distance so, unfortunately, the only way for us to spend time together right now is on call. This means I spend most days in the common area, spending hours on an uncomfortable sofa so he can remain in the room and I can watch things with her. Last night, when I was trying to get some sleep, I finally asked him if he would mind wearing his airpods, to which he agreed and I hoped that he would continue to do so in future. Instead, I've now noticed there's a degree of animosity between us and unfortunately his calls since then have remained on speaker. Lately, I feel like I have no escape from it because some of the other guys from our suite have started using the common room to also take their calls on speaker. This makes me question whether I'm overreacting to a normal thing. I just can't imagine doing that myself and subjecting people to my conversations. I wouldn't mind it as much if he'd just wear his headphones so that the volume isn't essentially doubled but he never does. I don't want to take further action before I know whether or not I'm in the wrong, so AITA?

We met at a show and have been dating off/on for almost 2 years. Since I can't be around that stuff, I don't choose to hang out with them as a group much. I used to be not so great and wanted to always be around if he was out. He complained a lot about never going out to the clubs with them and specifically without me (because I didn't always want to go). I felt like an asshole and  I realised that it's not my place to dictate that so these past few months I changed my tune and said I didn't care anymore, for him to hang with them as he pleased. However, instead of him doing that I found that he has been complaining saying I'm controlling (even when I've told him to go ahead) and has made me out to be terrible. He also has a temper and blows up over small things to the point I get scared. He says mean things like ""I hate you"" and calls me names -him acting this way is partly why I just gave in and said go ahead and do whatever (in hopes he would stop his tantrums and just go and leave me alone...) but instead he continues this hurtful behavior and doesn't go do anything...  Instead, he just keeps making me feel like I'm an asshole.

He also resorted to bullying me online. For clarification, I did block him on socials before when this happened but he made a throw-away or had his friends do it for him I guess. I also had random numbers messaging me saying ""wrong number but let's talk anyway..."" which I blocked, found strange and now guess it might have been him, I don't know.\^I think this is part of why leaving him seems hard.

I don't mind cleaning up but I think it should we both should  be cleaning and then we can start getting ready or vice versa.

I remember several months into the relationship he vented to me about how stressed out his dad was making him and he cried to me about it. The last 4 years he would routinely go and check on his father when he didnt answer his phone. Each time he had to prepare himself to walk in and find him dead which of course is horrific, no one should have to do that for their parent. Frequently his dad answers the door to him in his underwear and my husband has had to help him put pants on before. I didn't manage to even meet his dad until a couple months ago when he had one of his sober moments.Anyway he was on a 2 week streak of sobriety and then he rang my husband, who then put it on speakerphone.

I'm also scared that other family members will see me the same way.I understand alcoholism isn't something you'd wish on your worst enermy and it's a disease.

She went to the movies with a different friend we will call these people E and K (E invited me). E said that she did not take me because inly 1 person could go and and this was the first time K was allowed to go anywhere so thats why she chose to go with K. I later found out that my other friend A was with them. Me and the other girl in our friend group, i, have been being left out a-lot recently so i was not surprised and i just assumed they did not want to hurt my feelings but they keep doing it.

Recently me and E went on a trip out of town with her mom, for the first half of our trip E was on the phone with K and would not talk to me until there was no service and the call disconnected this made me upset but once again when i said something my feelings were dismissed.Im sorry if this was just a lot of rambling but i needed to say it and i want to know if they really are being mean, or if this is just petty high school drama and me an i are overreacting.

10vgpec,21,"About a week and a half ago I was walking my dog when a  tiny 9lb friendly doggie came running up to us. His ribs were showing, he smelled absolutely awful, had massive fleas on him, and had huge scabs on the inner side of his ears. I picked him up and brought him home with me where I gave him two baths, treated him with flea medicine, and put medicine that i had leftover from the vet I'm his ears. My dog and I played with him for a while before sending him off on his way. A few hours later, he was scratching at my door. So I let him in and let him spend the night since it was around 30° outside. He seemed to have been a stray for a while even though he was sweet and friendly. For example, when we went to sleep, he came up to my side but then just sat there and wouldn't lay down. When he started falling asleep, his head would droop before he finally surrendered and lied down. To me, this indicates that he's used to staying vigilant until he simply can't keep his eyes open anymore. He has since stopped doing this. The next day I let him out again but he came back. Also happened the following day. Since then, I've kept him in my house. It has been a week since I have claimed him. Yesterday while I was at work, he got out, my roommate chased him down and brought him back to our house. During this time, he heard a little boy say something like ""that's my dog."" My roommate says he brought him back to our house because the previous owner was not taking care of him at all. I prettymuch agree with him. I am torn about whether or not I should give him back to his previous neglectful owner.

10vo10r,13,"My high school friend (21F) and I (20F) hadn’t seen each other in a while since we go to different colleges but had the opportunity to go to a concert near our hometown (about a 15 min drive) together this past weekend. I was really excited to reconnect and also hear the band live. She agreed to pick me up and I offered to pay for parking. The day of the concert comes and I get a text from her 1 hour before she was supposed to pick me up and she says that she had a long day at work (she works in the food industry) and is too tired to drive us there safely and asks if I can drive instead. My sister took our shared car to run errands since I said I wouldn’t be needing it so I unfortunately couldn’t drive us. She then asked her parents if they could drop us off and they agreed. I also asked if she had enough energy for the concert/would like to rest and she said she could recharge in the car and over dinner. We eat dinner and wait in line and everything seems fine. We’re catching up and it was fun. However, 30 min into the concert (8:30), she tells me that her legs hurt and that she is tired and wants to go home. She said that she already contacted her parents and that I could either drive with them back or take an Uber home (my family members were all busy at the time). I ended up leaving with her and am definitely thankful for her parents to drive me back, but am upset to miss a majority of the concert. Even if I stayed, I would not feel comfortable being at the venue by myself and waiting for an Uber (which would also be pretty costly since everyone would be calling one).After that event, I have been responding to her messages as much and am upset because I feel like she shouldn’t have agreed to go with me if she knew she’d have a long day at work or she could have told me earlier if she couldn’t go. I’m addition, I don’t want to meet with her again because I am worried she will flake on me. Another time when we went to a concert together, we left a few songs early to beat traffic but didn’t miss the majority of the show. Others say I shouldn’t distance myself from her because she may be going through some things that I am not aware of or she is burnt out and I need to show empathy but I don’t know why she didn’t tell me prior.",AITA for being upset friend wanted to leave concert early?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vo10r/aita_for_being_upset_friend_wanted_to_leave/

10vsxu8,8," PART 1:My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year now, but I have known him for 3 years and we have been on and off. Our first relationship was terrible I was highly depressed and he was very sweet in the beginning but began drifting off and being extremely cold to me and rude. None of us were emotionally available as he has never been in a serious relationship and I had just recently left a toxic, abusive long relationship of about 3 years. We tried again but it was the same thing, he was great in the beginning but became uninterested and very cold. We are now on our third try and I would say final try for me at least, and he has improved greatly but we are still not where I was us to be after so long. He promised he would stick by my side and try his hardest for me as long as he could since he thinks we are perfect for each other. Again the relationship went extremely well during the honeymoon phase but fizzled out a bit but I think he is far better than the last times. He has still never said he Loves me which I find really odd and when I ask him about it he just tells me that he doesn't really know what love is. I feel like I am a really selfless and thoughtful girlfriend, I always make sure he is okay, I cook for him, when he is sick I am there for him, I buy him flowers, I show him off and praise him, and I always express myself to him when I think he looks great or how much I enjoyed our trips and dates. He is always willing to pay for meals and take me out and he always has this positive attitude. Sometimes though, I feel as though he doesn't value me or put me first which I know can be selfish to ask but I really want the person who I want to marry to always respect me and listen to me and be the best version of themselves. Recently I expressed to him that I didn't like it when he did donuts in his car or drove fast with me in the car because he did it so often and I just did not think it was safe and plus felt a little obnoxious to me. He got mad, called me boring and said that I should be happy because he has fun doing it and ""screw me"" for calling it obnoxious. He also doesn't buy me flowers ever because they are ""expensive"" so I buy him $10 ones just so he can see how cheap they are and how easy it is to get them. He did get me flowers for our anniversary but he got them right before he picked me up and they still had a price tag on them and they were nice but it felt like he just got them since he felt he had to. For thanksgiving his family came to visit from out of state and he has a big family so it was very special to him and I knew he would be very busy. I did not see him at all for two weeks because he had his family over, I constantly complained that I missed him a lot but said it lightheartedly and in a joking matter and I just wanted to see him even for a little bit but not once did he make time for me even though he could have and we live 10 minutes from each other.",AITA for Being Sad on my Boyfriend's Birthday?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vsxu8/aita_for_being_sad_on_my_boyfriends_birthday/

Me (F18) has a friend group of just three which includes me my friend we will call her H (F18) and another friend we will call D(F19). So H has this boyfriend who we will call C (M19) who is pretty cool me and him used to hang out so we were semi close and me and H have been friends since we were little and i met D Sophomore year of high school. So my mom and H’s boyfriend’s dad used to have a thing going on years ago because they worked in the same area and lived near each other but that was years ago, and now his dad is happily married and my mom doesn’t speak to him much out of respect. One day my mom told me and H that her and H’s bf’s dad used to mess around and as soon as she said it she said “don’t tell your bf” why?

My last straw was when he said “Your mom might just think I’m attractive then huh I’m my dad’s twin” i instantly shut down and stopped talking H continued laughing at him thinking it was funny and i didn’t find it funny at all. Now my friend D noticed this and tried to stop them and tell them i was becoming irritated but they didn’t want to listen so i just walked off and ignored them all day, and have been getting different texts from H saying “come on it was a joke no need to get all pissy about it”.

Well come Monday and I asked him where it is and now he is claiming he flat out doesn’t have it. I told him that he was the last one who had my charger and we argued back and forth but I didn’t want it to turn into a fight so we stopped there but I definitely know he has it. It’s fine if he took it home with him by accident cause that happens. I’m just confused because he is the only person who usually ever asks for my charger and no one else has. So I told my mom about it and she said I am too nice and need to be assertive.

10vmomh,15,"Some background: my (31F) best friend ""Ryan"" (38M) quit his 6-figure office job in 2019, was unemployed for most of 2020 and 2021, and started following his dreams of becoming a production designer/prop master for film and TV in 2022. As a result of being unemployed for so long and trying to get started as a beginner in a volatile industry, he is deeply in debt. And as a production designer he can pretty much justify buying anything because maybe it will be useful as a prop in the future.However, I also think he has somewhat of a shopping addiction? Whenever I see him he has new electronics, or tools, or designer clothes, and justifies it through some complicated credit card scheme or says he thinks his mom can be convinced pay off his debt, or that he will be making more as a production designer in the future. I think he procrastinates on looking for work or tries to avoid thinking about finding work by buying expensive things, and it stresses me out. A few days ago he mentioned that his mom came into some money and might be offering to buy him a house if he is successful in his career, so we discussed the possibility of buying a duplex together in the future.Yesterday we were at brunch with some friends and he asked if he should buy an expensive 3D printer that he could probably use to make props for work. Everyone said ""yeah that sounds like fun"" but I gave a definite ""no absolutely not"" because I know him well enough to know he just came up with this idea while procrastinating on updating his portfolio and promoting his business. Since we were with other people I didn't say out loud that it's because he has a shopping addiction and is making poor financial choices, and being overly dependent on the women in his life to bail him out, but that was the subtext. He got mad at me for being so worried about what he buys, and I also looked pretty not-fun at brunch for shutting down his creativity.I can't tell if I'm an asshole for enabling him to dig himself deeper into debt, or if I'm an asshole for not minding my own business.

So she ask me if she and her friend can move with us.  We were thinking move in with another friend but I prioritize my cousin and her friend because of family. So we start to look for 4B apartment with no luck. Then our landlord ask us if we gonna stay and increase our rent 20%. Me and best friend can’t afford that by ourselves so we agree to renewing the lease and live the 4 girls in our apartment for 1 year.When they move in, they don’t have a job. Start looking and my cousin were jumping for work to work because she doesn’t feel the right vibes but always complaining about money.  We have fights about chores of the house all started by my cousin, she like to be in control and manage everyone. She starts saying that she wasn’t feel ok here. That her mental health was bad so she one day she said to us she is gonna go back to the state where she was with her friend. Her friend wasn’t happy because they didn’t discuss it and my cousin said to her just come. We were worried about the rent but they assure they gonna continuous paying. Long story short they try to work but for my cousin things weren’t the same there, so they come back a week later. At the end of last year my cousin get sick and must go the hospital twice. Everyone was taking care of her even my friend group who she don’t treat that well try to help as much as they could.

My dad with unlimited PTO won’t and he knows I work as well and doesn’t respect that or even try to take off earlier to take her to some of her earlier appointments, this leading to me having to miss work and pay or constantly have to pay to charge my car because she uses it to drive it to her appointments that are usually over 40 miles away from our house.

We have been working together for a year now and all get on pretty well and have similar interests.Midway through Saturday Abby felt unwell. She suspected she'd eaten something that upset her tummy and decided to go home alone.That night Bella randomly expressed some extreme views on religion and abortion. Neither myself nor Cassie had brought up things even tangentially related. At first I did worry Cassie had similar views because they've worked together a lot longer and Bella was so comfortable to say these things I assumed she knew she would be supported, but when I said ''I disagree and think we should leave it there'' Cassie agreed with me.This made Bella burst into tears. It was really weird. She continued to cry on and off for a couple of hours. She directly told us we were both going to hell, for different offenses, and so were specific members of our family for various reasons. Each time myself or Cassie tried to shutdown the conversation, as we could both see it was going nowhere and there was no convincing to be had on either side, she would cry harder, accusing us of ganging up on her and breaking her heart by ''fighting against salvation''.I have since distanced myself entirely from Bella. Her views are honestly much too extreme for me. I did not tell anyone what had happened, but Abby noticed the sudden shift. We are the only four women in our department, and we used to frequently grab dinner and such which I now decline. Abby kept asking about why shut Bella out and eventually I told her. I did not go into huge detail, just said we had conflicting moral views and I felt uncomfortable being around her now I know how she views myself and my family.Abby went to Bella to confirm and Bella went into more detail. Abby does not agree with her at all and has since iced her out too. This has caused Bella to post tirades on social media (other colleagues have shown me as I removed her from my social media), claiming we are socially ostracizing her, bullying her and attempting to pressure her to fall into our ''sinful ideologies''.Now people in the wider office space are aware of her extreme stances and a lot them are avoiding her. She came to my house uninvited and told me I had no right to discuss our private conversation with people that were not there and that I am causing her to lose job opportunities by gossiping about her...I don't think IATA for speaking up and disagreeing with her that evening, but I'm wondering if I'm TA for telling Abby and inadvertently causing our workplace in general to find out?

I called ahead and the person that answered said they have lots of gluten free dishes or ones that can be made to be GF. I’m afraid my family will think I’m a jerk for choosing somewhere my siblings don’t want to eat/my parents might not like. Growing up we ate Chinese/Mexican take out but we never tried anything else. My parents and siblings eat the same thing and often don’t try new foods.

10vn7hb,47,"Every time i text this person, they get bent out of shape because i send them 5 'one sentence' texts instead of one '5 sentence paragraph.' I say they are passive aggressive and being a control freak. They say i don't understand phone etiquette. Nobody else says this to me. Nobody else seems to mind that i don't condense my messages into one long paragraph. Other people text me lots of little messages. I don't mind whatsoever.

10vptdp,19,"I (25M) have been married to my wife (25F) for half a year now. We had our honeymoon in Turkiye and it was beautiful but she said it was too short for her because we only had 6 days there. That was also the first time we ever went on vacation together.Today we had talked about traveling and going on holiday to various places. She was excited about going on vacation again since she only ever went with her family and they never let her travel alone or with friends since she grew up very sheltered. She also started talking about how great our honeymoon was and that it was the best trip she ever had. I agreed but added that I would rather go on vacation with our families next time. She asked why and I answered that it is more fun being around loved ones. She got offended and acted like I said I don't want be alone with her and always want my own family with me (she says this all the time). I thought it was ridiculous that she got so insulted by me saying I want BOTH our families there and told her if she was seriously getting upset over something trivial I said. She said I phrased it weirdly and it is hurtful because we only went on vacation once, only for a short period of time and she has always been with her family and she wants to make memories with the both of us alone and later with our parents. I said she was being ridiculous and dramatic. She has been acting sulky ever since.I love her, I love my family and I love her family so I want to go on a trip together. How can she get upset over that?

10vj4o5,6,"To start things off I’m the only guy in this friend group that’s straight so accusations of me liking my “friends” came up often. None of them are dateable as graycei vapes Olivia is a stoner and Evie isn’t my type and is much too needy and experienced in relationships. I was asked for advice by (E) on how to get the attention of a guy she liked who we can call pedo stache, she just broke up with her ex and immediately fell in love with pedo stache even though truth be told he is a solid 4/10 and she is a 6-7/10. She asked me how to get his attention and I told her to start genuine conversations with him and don’t just do and say stuff to get a result. I also said not to act like an attention wh*re and to slow down and take time before you rush into another relationship you don’t want (happened with her ex). She told our friends about this and they confronted me saying she said I was annoying and that I called her a bunch of derogatory names basically calling her a wh*re. I texted her about this and she told me to hold on and she’ll find out by texting them. That brings us to now where it’s been 30 minutes and I still haven’t been updated on what’s going on.Additional details Graycei has a history of getting close to people and making stuff up about them and even spread a rumor about Evie.Olivia is a massive gremlin and is always rude mean and angry but she says it’s “just the we I am”Any advice is wanted and tbh I might just ditch them as it’s something new every week.",AITA for giving relationship advice and pissing off my friends?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vj4o5/aita_for_giving_relationship_advice_and_pissing/
